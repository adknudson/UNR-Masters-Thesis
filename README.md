# Alex Knudson - Masters Thesis

The HTML version of my thesis can be viewed offline by cloning an earlier version of this repo and opening the docs folder. The folder was removed in the latest commit due to vulnerabilities of JQuery, and me no longer being able to render new versions of the thesis using newer versions of libraries on which my code depends on. I do not have the energy to maintain this code, nor to put in the effort to figure out which versions of libraries would work to keep the code running. In short, learn from my mistake and use `renv` early on to ensure that your projects maintain reproducibility ;D
