# Background to Modeling {#background}

- Generalized Linear Models
  - classical approaches to fitting/estimation
    - Maximum likelihood estimation
      - Simple and almost every piece of statistical software will have an implementation
  - Expectation Maximization
  - Random effects (Gelmen and Hill)
  - Bayesian GLMs
    - Completely reliant on MCMC

- Model-free estimations (footnote? remark?)
  - non-parametric models
  - [@zchaluk2009model]

- Bayesian logistic regression
  - @gelman2008weakly
  - Can't completely express the structure (hierarchy) of the data

- Residual Analysis
  - using the fitted values vs. the observed values to evaluate goodness of fit
  - 

- So what's the answer?
  - The last two options (bayes + multilevel) when on their own do well, but are not robust to 
 
- shortcomings
  - Convergence failure in the presence of complete separation
