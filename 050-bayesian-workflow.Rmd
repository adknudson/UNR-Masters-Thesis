# Principled Bayesian Workflow {#workflow}

- Standardizing Predictors
- Parameterization of the linear predictor
  - Choice of Link Function
  - Choice of Priors
  - lapse rates


In other words we can evaluate a model by answering four questions.

Question One: Domain Expertise Consistency
Is our model consistent with our domain expertise?

Question Two: Computational Faithfulness
Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors?

Question Three: Inferential Adequacy
Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions?

Question Four: Model Adequacy
Is our model rich enough to capture the relevant structure of the true data generating process?
