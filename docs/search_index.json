For example, if \\(j[35]=3\\), then the \\(35^{th}\\) unit in the data belongs to the third age group. Coefficients are written with \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and sometimes \\(\\gamma\\) We make our code more readable by typing \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) as a, b, g Standard deviation is \\(\\sigma_y\\) for data-level errors and \\(\\sigma_\\alpha\\), \\(\\sigma_\\beta\\), and so forth, for group-level errors References "],
