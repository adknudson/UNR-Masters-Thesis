Knudson December, 2020 1 Introduction With the advances in computational power and high-level programming languages like Python, R, and Julia, statistical methods have evolved to be more flexible and expressive. No longer must we be subjugated by p-values and step-wise regression techniques. Gone are the days of using clever modeling techniques to tame misbehaved data. Now is the time for principled and informed decisions to create bespoke models and domain-motivated analyses. We have the shoulders of giants to stand upon and look out at the vast sea of data science. I want to talk about how the advances in computational power have lead to a sort of mini revolution - resurrection - in statistics where Bayesian modeling has gained an incredible following thanks to projects like Stan. The steady adoption of computer aided statistical workflows also brings the need for multidisciplinary techniques from numerical analysis, probability theory, statistics, computer science, visualizations, and more. And with the age of computers, there is a strong push towards reproducibility. Concepts of modular design, workflows, project history and versioning, virtual environments, and human readable code all contribute to reproducible analyses. And somehow I also want to tie in how data is immutable - raw data should (must) be treated as a constant and unchangeable entity, and merely touching it will cause data mitosis. I will now segue into introducing the intent of this paper. I believe that utilizing the computational ability of modern computers helps strengthen the validity of an analysis. This is achieved by using powerful but expressive tools like Stan to write models that visually match written mathematical models. Classical statistical tools, while fast, require clever mathematics to perform certain routines such as fitting mixed effects models or the interpretation of cryptic p-values to determine if a model is “good”. Instead I believe we should be moving towards probabilistic programming languages like Stan to carry out Statistical analyses. This paper is motivated by an experiment in psychometrics (chapter 2), and by highlighting a principled workflow I seek to convince the reader that Bayesian multilevel modeling should be the default tool for modeling psychometric experiments. In the next section of this introduction, I will list classical tools for statistical modeling [of psychometric experiments] and touch on the limitations of such tools. Following that section, I will introduce the methods I use for building a model that deviate from classical methods. 1.1 Everything can be Blamed on Fisher … or Pearson, or Gauss, or … When I hear the term “regression”, I instantly think about maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters. And why not? There is an endless wealth of literature on the subject of linear regression and MLE (Johnson, Wichern, and others 2002; Larsen and Marx 2005; Sheather 2009; Navidi 2015). Most introductory courses on statistics and regression center around classical techniques such as MLE, hypothesis testing, and residual analysis. For the common student, learning statistical modeling in classical way can feel sterilized and mechanic. Check that the data are normal. Check that the coefficients are significantly different from zero. Check that the residuals are normal. Etc. I’m not trying to say that these methods are not important or that they are deeply flawed - it would be bad for modern society if we were just now finding out that the models are wrong. Instead, I am arguing that because they are so common and easy to apply that they are used without much extra thought. Take variable selection as an example. In a data set where there are a dozen predictors, how does one go about selecting which parameters produce the best model? Without thought, one may reach for a step-wise selection algorithm, and confidently conclude that variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are significant because the p-values say so. This method does fall apart quickly because as the number of parameters grow, so too does the number of steps needed to find the best subset of variables1, and there is no guarantee that the algorithm actually selects the best2 subset. But even if the best subset of variables is found, one still needs to consider if the variables have a practical effect or if the model omitted an important variable of interest. Sure, the type of analysis is important to the techniques used. Variable selection through step-wise algorithms or penalized maximum likelihood estimation (Hoerl and Kennard 1970; Tibshirani 1996) may be appropriate in an exploratory data analysis, but improper for causal inference and other scientifically motivated experiments. Which brings me to talk next about p-values, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. The concept of basing scientific results on the falsifiability (Popper 1959) or refutability of a claim is a strong foundation for the scientific method, and is arguably much better than the previous grounds of verifiability – just because something has been true for a very long time, doesn’t mean it will always be true in the future. But hypothesis testing comes with its own set of problems. Null hypothesis testing for point estimates usually depends on calculating a confidence interval and seeing if the interval contains the point of interest. This can be misleading, as there is more than one confidence interval that can be calculated. For Gaussian distributions, the mean equals the median equals the mode, so a 95% confidence interval is evenly distributed around the central measures. Some distributions are skewed, so an equal tail area confidence interval might not necessarily include the most likely value. Take for example the exponential distribution \\[ X \\sim \\mathrm{exponential} (\\lambda) \\] An equal tail area 95% confidence interval would be \\(\\left(-\\ln(0.975)/\\lambda, -\\ln(0.025)/\\lambda\\right)\\) which would not even contain the most likely value of zero. Should the highest density interval be used? Should skewness be reported with p-values and confidence intervals? Furthermore, confidence intervals are conditional on the model chosen, and that introduces other problems. McElreath (2020) discusses a well-known issue in population biology about comparing a neutral model of the distribution of allele frequencies to a selective model. In short, the two differing hypotheses may suggest different process models which in turn lead to statistical models - some of which are shared by both hypotheses. Rejecting the statistical model doesn’t rule out either of the hypotheses. Should we scrap these principles and tools all together? Absolutely not. Most of these wrinkled problems (and others) have been talked about and ironed out through careful discussion and clever techniques, but the damage is done, and hypothesis testing and p-values are widely misunderstood and misused. The problem is that these techniques rest on having a strong foundation of statistical knowledge, both to produce and to properly understand. This requirement is stifling. Communicating statistical results is just as important as producing them, and with modern tools and a vast selection of expressive languages we can analyze data in a more intuitive and natural framework. 1.2 Proposal of New Methods In my biased opinion, the Bayesian framework for modeling is a much more natural way to conduct scientific research where some kind of data analysis is involved. Now of course, I can’t claim as such without some compelling argument or examples. I have already targeted some weak points of classical statistics, and throughout Chapter 3 I will highlight specific examples of where classical techniques are typically applied, and how they may fall short compared to my proposal methods. What I am proposing is a fully Bayesian workflow to build and analyze a statistical model. In this Bayesian workflow (which shall hence be referred to simply as “workflow”) I will highlight a set of principles that utilize domain expertise, and focus around building a multilevel model. My goal is to show that the combination of these two concepts yields better prediction results and greater inferential power. And in lieu of p-values and hypothesis testing, I let predictive inference narrate the statistical results and strength of association within the model. 1.3 Organization I have organized this thesis as follows. In Chapter 2 I introduce the data set that drives the narrative and that motivates the adoption of Bayesian multilevel modeling. In Chapter 3 I describe and work through a principled Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling. Chapter 4 goes into more depth on checking the model goodness of fit and model diagnostics in a Bayesian setting. In Chapter 5 I demonstrate how to use the Bayesian model from the principled workflow for predictive inference, and use posterior predictive distributions to plot and compare models. Chapters 5 and 6 go over the quantitative results and discuss the qualitative choices in the workflow. Then I conclude this paper in Chapter 7.

Sir Francis Galton, inspired by Darwin’s ideas, became interested in the differences in human beings and in how to measure those differences. Though the dark side of statistics and hubris lead Galton to become a pioneer of eugenics, his works on studying and measuring human differences lead to the creation of psychometrics – the science of measuring mental faculties. Around the same time that he was developing his theories, Johann Friedrich Herbart was also interested in studying consciousness through the scientific method, and is responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind. E.H. Weber built upon Herbart’s work, and sought out to prove the idea of a psychological threshold. A psychological threshold is a minimum stimulus intensity necessary to activate a sensory system – a liminal stimulus. He paved the way for experimental psychology and is the namesake of Weber’s Law – the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus (Britannica 2014). \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{I} = k \\] To put this law into practice, consider holding a 1 kg weight (\\(I = 1\\)), and further suppose that we can just detect the difference between a 1 kg weight and a 1.2 kg weight (\\(\\Delta I = 0.2\\)). Then the constant just noticeable ratio is \\[ k = \\frac{0.2}{1} = 0.2 \\] So now if we pick up a 10 kg weight, we should be able to determine how much more mass is required to just detect a difference: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{10} = 0.2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta I = 2 \\] The difference between a 10 kg and a 12 kg weight should be just barely perceptible. Notice that the difference in the first set of weights is 0.2 and in the second set it is 2. Our perception of the difference in stimulus intensities is not absolute, but relative. G.T. Fechner devised the law (Weber-Fechner Law) that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. \\[S = K \\ln I\\] An example to this law is to consider two light sources, one that is 100 lumens (\\(S_1 = K \\ln 100\\)) and another that is 200 lumens (\\(S_2 = K \\ln 200\\)). The intensity of the second light is not perceived as twice as bright, but only about 1.15 times as bright according to the Weber-Fechner law. \\[\\theta = S_2 / S_1 \\approx 1.15\\] Notice that the value \\(K\\) cancels out when calculating the relative intensity, but knowing \\(K\\) can lead to important psychological insights; insights about differences between persons or groups of people! What biological and contextual factors affect how people perceive different stimuli? How do we measure their perception in a meaningful way? As one might expect, we can collect data from psychometric experiments, fit a model to the data from a family of functions called psychometric functions, and inspect key operating characteristics of those functions. 2.1 Psychometric Experiments Psychometric experiments are devised in a way to examine psychophysical processes, or the response between the world around us and our inward perceptions. A psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task (Wichmann and Hill 2001). Psychometric functions were studied as early as the late 1800’s, and Edwin Boring published a chart of the psychometric function in The American Journal of Psychology in 1917 (Boring 1917). Figure 2.1: A chart of the psychometric function. The experiment in this paper places two points on a subject’s skin separated by some distance, and has them answer their impression of whether there is one point or two, recorded as either ‘two points’ or ‘not two points’. As the separation of aesthesiometer points increases, so too does the subject’s confidence in their perception of ‘two-ness’. So at what separation is the impression of two points liminal? Figure 2.1 displays the key aspects of the psychometric function. The most crucial part is the sigmoid function, the S-like non-decreasing curve which in this case is represented by the Normal CDF, \\(\\Phi(\\gamma)\\). The horizontal axis represents the stimulus stimulus intensity, the separation of two points in centimeters. The vertical axis represents the probability that a subject has the impression of two points. With only experimental data, the response proportion becomes an approximation for the probability. This leads me to talk about the type of psychometric experiment that this paper deals with called a temporal order judgment (TOJ) experiment. The concept is that if there are two distinct stimuli occurring nearly simultaneously then our brains will bind them into a single percept (perceive them as happening simultaneously). Compensation for small temporal differences is beneficial for coherent multisensory experiences, particularly in visual-speech synthesis as it is necessary to maintain an accurate representation of the sources of multisensory events. The temporal asynchrony between stimuli is called the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and the range of SOAs for which sensory signals are integrated into a global percept is called the temporal binding window. When the SOA grows too large then the brain segregates the two signals and the temporal order can be determined. Our experiences in life as we age shape the mechanisms of processing multisensory signals, and some multisensory signals are integrated much more readily than others. Perceptual synchrony has been previously studied through the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) – the temporal delay between two signals at which an observer is unsure about their temporal order (Stone et al. 2001). The temporal binding window is the time span over which sensory signals arising from different modalities appear integrated into a global percept. A deficit in temporal sensitivity may lead to a widening of the temporal binding window and reduce the ability to segregate unrelated sensory signals. In temporal order judgment tasks, the ability to discriminate the timing of multiple sensory signals is referred to as temporal sensitivity, and is studied through the measurement of the just noticeable difference (JND) – the smallest lapse in time so that a temporal order can just be determined. Figure 2.2 highlights the features through which we study psychometric functions. The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing (i.e. the response probability is 50%). The JND is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 84% level3 and the PSS, though the upper level often depends on domain expertise. Figure 2.2: The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing. The just noticeable difference is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 0.84 level and the PSS, though the upper level depends on domain expertise. Perceptual synchrony and temporal sensitivity can be modified through a baseline understanding. In order to perceive physical events as simultaneous, our brains must adjust for differences in temporal delays of transmission of both psychical signals and sensory processing (Fujisaki et al. 2004). In some cases such as with audiovisual stimuli, the perception of simultaneity can be modified by repeatedly presenting the audiovisual stimuli at fixed time separations (called an adapter stimulus) to an observer (Vroomen et al. 2004). This repetition of presenting the adapter stimulus is called temporal recalibration. The data set that I introduce in the next section concerns temporal order judgment across various sensory modalities with a temporal recalibration component. 2.2 Temporal Order Judgment Data Which came first, the chicken or the experimentally controlled stimulus The data set that I am using in this paper comes from experiments done by A.N. Scurry and Dr. F. Jiang in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. Reduced temporal sensitivity in the aging population manifests in an impaired ability to perceive synchronous events as simultaneous, and similarly more difficulty in segregating asynchronous sensory signals that belong to different sources. The consequences of a widening of the temporal binding window is considered in Scurry et al. (2019), as well as a complete detailing of the experimental setup and recording process. A shortened summary of the methods is provided below. There are four different tasks in the experiment: audio-visual, visual-visual, visual-motor, and duration, and I will refer to each task respectively as audiovisual, visual, sensorimotor, and duration. The participants consist of 15 young adults (age 20-27), 15 middle age adults (age 39-50), and 15 older adults (age 65-75), all recruited from the University of Nevada, Reno. Additionally all subjects are right handed and were reported to have normal or corrected to normal hearing and vision. Table 2.1: Sample of motivating data. soa response sid task trial age_group age sex -350 0 O-m-BC audiovisual pre older_adult 70 M -200 0 M-m-SJ duration post1 middle_age 48 M 28 1 O-f-KK sensorimotor pre older_adult 66 F 275 1 O-f-MW visual post1 older_adult 69 F In the audiovisual TOJ task, participants were asked to determine the temporal order between an auditory and visual stimulus. Stimulus onset asynchrony values were selected uniformly between -500 to +500 ms with 50 ms steps, where negative SOAs indicated that the visual stimulus was leading, and positive values indicated that the auditory stimulus was leading. Each SOA value was presented 5 times in random order in the initial block. At the end of each trial the subject was asked to report if the auditory stimulus came before the visual, where a \\(1\\) indicates that they perceived the sound first, and a \\(0\\) indicates that they perceived the visual stimulus first. A similar setup is repeated for the visual, sensorimotor, and duration tasks. The visual task presented two visual stimuli on the left and right side of a display with temporal asynchronies that varied between -300 ms to +300 ms with 25 ms steps. Negative SOAs indicated that the left stimulus was first, and positive that the right came first. A positive response indicates that the subject perceived the right stimulus first. The sensorimotor task has subjects focus on a black cross on a screen. When it disappears, they respond by pressing a button. Additionally, when the cross disappears, a visual stimulus was flashed on the screen, and subjects were asked if they perceived the visual stimulus before or after their button press. The latency of the visual stimulus was partially determined by individual subject’s average response time, so SOA values are not fixed between subjects and trials. A positive response indicates that the visual stimulus was perceived after the button press. The duration task presents two vertically stacked circles on a screen with one appearing right after the other. The top stimulus appeared for a fixed amount of time of 300 ms, and the bottom was displayed for anywhere between +100 ms to +500 ms in 50 ms steps corresponding to SOA values between -200 ms to +200 ms. The subject then responds to if they perceived the bottom circle as appearing longer than the top circle. Table 2.2: Summary of TOJ Tasks Task Positive Response Positive SOA Truth Audiovisual Perceived audio first Audio came before visual Visual Perceived right first Right came before left Sensorimotor Perceived visual first Visual came before tactile Duration Perceived bottom as longer Bottom lasted longer than top Finally, after the first block of each task was completed, the participants went through an adaptation period where they were presented with the respective stimuli from each task repeatedly at fixed temporal delays, then they repeated the task. To ensure that the adaptation affect persisted, the subject were presented with the adapter stimulus at regular intervals throughout the second block. The blocks are designated as pre and post1, post2, etc. in the data set. In this paper I will only be focusing on the pre and post1 blocks. 2.3 Data Visualizations and Quirks The dependent variable in these experiments is the perceived response which is encoded as a 0 or a 1, and the independent variable is the SOA value. If the response is plotted against the SOA values, then it is difficult to determine any relationship (see figure 2.3). Transparency can be used to better visualize the relationships between SOA value and responses. The center plot in figure 2.3 uses the same data as the left plot, except that the transparency is set to 0.05. As a result, one can see that there is a higher density of “0” responses towards more negative SOAs, and a higher density of “1” responses for more positive SOAs. Taking it a step further, I can compute and plot the proportion of responses for a given SOA. This is displayed in the right panel. Now the relationship between SOA values and responses is clear – as the SOA value goes from more negative to more positive, the proportion of positive responses increases from near 0 to near 1. Figure 2.3: Left: Simple plot of response vs. soa value. Center: A plot of response vs. soa with transparency. Right: A plot of proportions vs. soa with transparency. Subjectively the right plot in figure 2.3 is the easiest to interpret. Because of this, I will often present the observed and predicted data using the proportion of responses rather than the actual response. Proportional data also has the advantage of being bounded on the same interval as the response. For the audiovisual task, the responses can be aggregated into binomial data – the number of positive responses for given SOA value – which is sometimes more efficient to work with than the Bernoulli data (see table 2.3). However the number of times an SOA is presented varies between the pre-adaptation and post-adaptation blocks; 5 and 3 times per SOA respectively. Table 2.3: Audiovisual task with aggregated responses. trial soa n k proportion pre 200 5 4 0.80 150 5 5 1.00 -350 5 0 0.00 post1 350 3 3 1.00 -500 3 1 0.33 -200 3 0 0.00 Other quirks about the data pertain to the subjects. There is one younger subject that did not complete the audiovisual task, and one younger subject that did not complete the duration task. Additionally there is one older subject who’s response data for the post-adaptation audiovisual task is unreasonable4 (see figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Post-adaptation response data for O-f-CE It is unreasonable because, of all the negative SOAs, there were only two correct responses5. If a subject is randomly guessing the temporal order, then a naive estimate for the proportion of correct responses is 0.5. If a subject’s proportion of correct responses is above 0.5, then they are doing better than random guessing. In figure 2.5 it is seen that subject O-f-CE is the only one who’s proportion is below 0.5 (and by a considerable amount). Figure 2.5: Proportion of correct responses for negative SOA values during the post-adaptation audiovisual experiment. The consequences of leaving in this experimental block in the data is considered in the Chapter 6, but it is a clear outlier that must be noted. When this method of detecting outliers is repeated for all tasks and blocks, then I end up with 17 records in total (see figure 2.6), one of which is the aforementioned subject. Figure 2.6: Proportion of correct responses across all tasks and blocks Proportions are calculated individually for positive and negative SOAs. Most of the records that are flagged by this method of outlier detection are from the sensorimotor task, and none are from the visual task. This may be attributed to the perceived difficulty of the task. One consequence of higher temporal sensitivity is that it is easier to determine temporal order. It may also be that determining temporal order is inherently easier for certain multisensory tasks compared to others. Since the sensorimotor task does not have fixed SOA values like the other tasks, it may be perceived as more difficult. Or perhaps the mechanisms that process tactile and visual signals are not as well coupled as those that process audio and visual signals. Once again, I’ll consider the handling of the sensorimotor outliers in the results chapter. Now that I have introduced the motivating data and some of the theory behind psychometric experiments, I am ready to introduce a Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling of the psychometric function. If the reader is interested in a fun story, in the discussion chapter I talk about the process I went through to read in this psychometric data, clean it up, and produce a tidy data set that is ready for modeling. While data cleaning and transforming is a topic entirely to itself, it is not the main focus of this paper.

I was hoping to build up the suspense. Well I hope you’re now ready for the answer. A principled Bayesian workflow is a method of employing domain expertise and statistical knowledge to iteratively build a statistical model that satisfies the constraints and goals set forth by the researcher. Oh, and Bayesian techniques are used in exchange for classical ones. What about the multilevel aspect? While I get into that more in the following sections, the concept is simple. Multilevel models should be the default. The alternatives are models with complete pooling, or models with no pooling. Pooling vs. no pooling is a fancy way of saying that all the data is modeled as a whole, or the smallest component (group) is modeled individually. The former implies that the variation between groups is zero (all groups are the same), and the latter implies that the variation between groups is infinite (no groups are the same). Multilevel models assume that the truth is somewhere in the middle of zero and infinity. That’s not a difficult thing to posit. Hierarchical models are a specific kind of multilevel model where one or more groups are nested within a larger one. In the case of the psychometric data, there are three age groups, and within each age group are individual subjects. Multilevel modeling provides a way to quantify and apportion the variation within the data to each level in the model.

Often I found myself putting in vast amounts of unnecessary work - but necessary for me to do in order to realize that it is unnecessary - just because I hadn’t yet learned what the likely paths to take were. On a more personal level, my struggles were not ever really in developing a model or coding it up - in fact I could tinker with a program for hours, improving it in this way or that. For me, programming was a puzzle and an art, and I internalized the idea that I could figure out any numerical task given enough time and focus. To the contrary, I believed that writing was a chore, that writing this thesis would be like trying to dam up all the deltas in an attempt to keep the main river on course. I think of learning mathematics as learning a puzzle game. The first few puzzles are easy, but then get progressively harder. But even as the puzzles get harder, your intuitive understanding of the game improves, and you can throw away the obviously poor moves from consideration, and try paths that are more likely to move you in the direction of the correct solution. I started my journey towards obtaining a Master of Science in Statistics precisely because I knew that I could obtain a more intuitive understanding of the quantitative world that I live in, and pick up some new tools along the way to create and solve more impressive puzzles.
