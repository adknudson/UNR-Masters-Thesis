["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Soft intro to modern computing, analysis advance in CPU+programming leads to evolved statistical methods ML/DL, high dimensional analysis, big data, Bayesian techniques multidisciplinary techniques; numerical methods, probability theory, statistics, computer science, visualizations, etc root finding, change of variables, Gaussian quadrature, Hermite polynomials, Monte Carlo simulation, floating point arithmetic Organization and reproducibility are crucial in a data analysis setting pre-planning, modularity, workflows, versioning, virtual environments, DRY programming, code that is easy to read Clean data is important for good modeling garbage in leads to garbage out With the advances in computational power and high-level programming languages like Python, R, and Julia, statistical methods have evolved to be more flexible and expressive. Overview of classical modeling methods classical approaches to data analysis usually adhere to the flexibility-interpretability trade-off generally inflexible (parametric) to be more interpretable and computationally easier sometimes a model is too flexible (non-parametric) and loses crucial inferential power sometimes our assumptions about the data are invalid normality, independence, heteroskedacity, etc. often limited when it comes to statistical summaries and confidence intervals Solutions or alternatives when classical models fail Bayesian inference is a powerful, descriptive, and flexible modeling framework Bayes theorem is a simple model of incorporating prior information and data to produce a posterior probability or distribution \\(P(\\theta | X) \\propto P(X | \\theta) * P(\\theta)\\) or \\(posterior \\propto prior \\times likelihood\\) The prior is some distribution over the parameter space The likelihood is the probability of an outcome in the sample space given a value in the parameter space The posterior is the likelihood of values in the parameter space after observing values from the sample space Bayesian statistics, when described without math, actually feels natural to most people you hear hoof beats, you think horses, not zebras [unless you’re in Africa, but that’s prior information ;)] The catch is that the model is not complete as written above There is actually a denominator in Bayes’ Theorem \\(P(\\theta | X) = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\sum_i P(X | \\theta_i)} = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\int_\\Omega P(X | \\theta)d\\theta}\\) In general, the denominator is not known, or is not not easy (or possible) to calculate, but it always evaluates to a constant (hence the “proportional to”) The denominator acts as a scaling value that forces \\(P(\\theta|X)\\) to be a probability distribution (i.e. area under PDF is equal to 1) There are simulation-based techniques that let one approximate the posterior distribution without needing to know the analytic solution to the denominator I have organized this thesis as follows. In Chapter 2 I introduce the data set that drives the narrative and that motivates the adoption of Bayesian multilevel modeling. In Chapter 3 there is a review of common approaches approaches to modeling with psychometric data, and the benefits and drawbacks of such techniques. Chapter 4 introduces Bayesian hierarchical modeling and programming frameworks for Bayesian inference. In Chapter 5 I describe and work through a principled Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling. Chapter 6 goes into more depth on checking the model goodness of fit and model diagnostics in a Bayesian setting. Finally in Chapter 7 I demonstrate how to use the Bayesian model from the principled workflow for predictive inference, and use posterior predictive distributions to plot and compare models. "],
["motivating-data.html", "2 Motivating Data", " 2 Motivating Data Background of psychometrics Charles Darwin at the core, with the ideas that living organisms adapt to their environment Sir Francis Galton lead the creation of psychometrics “This idea stimulated Galton’s interest in the study of human beings and how they differ one from another and, more importantly, how to measure those differences” Galton devised and conducted “mental” tests “Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind, which were influential in educational practices in years to come.” “E.H. Weber built upon Herbart’s work and tried to prove the existence of a psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to activate a sensory system” “G.T. Fechner … devise[d] the law that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity” Psychometric Experiments “The psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task” (Wichmann and Hill 2001) Studied as early as the late 1800’s (Boring 1917) Perceptual Synchrony Our experiences in life as we age shape the mechanisms of processing multisensory signals Compensation for small temporal differences is beneficial for coherent multisensory experiences, particularly in visual-speech synthesis This gives rise to an idea of the temporal binding window, or the temporal differences for which sensory signals are integrated into a global percept Perceptual synchrony has been previously studied through the point of subjective simultaneity, the physical temporal delay between two signals at which an observer is unsure about their temporal order (Stone et al. 2001) Temporal Sensitivity The temporal binding window is the time span over which sensory signals arising from different modalities appear integrated into a global percept A deficit in temporal sensitivity may lead to a widening of the temporal binding window and cause reduce the ability to segregate unrelated sensory signals In temporal order judgment tasks, the ability to discriminate the timing of multiple sensory signals is referred to as temporal sensitivity, and is studied through the measurement of the just noticeable difference The just noticeable difference is the smallest lapse in time so that a temporal order can just be determined Temporal Recalibration Our perceptual synchrony can be modified through a baseline understanding Temporal Order Judgment Psychometric Experiment Setup and Methods Data collection Order of trials The manuscript provided by Ally will really be the main source of content for this section She describes the data collection for three of the sensory tasks Data cleaning and loading Research questions Observations about the data Outliers and failed experiments balance of classes (male v female, young v middle v older, etc.) Tasks In the workflow section, I will look for and point out any visual trends in the data References "],
