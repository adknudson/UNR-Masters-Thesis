Overview of classical modeling methods classical approaches to data analysis usually adhere to the flexibility-interpretability trade-off generally inflexible (parametric) to be more interpretable and computationally easier sometimes a model is too flexible (non-parametric) and loses crucial inferential power sometimes our assumptions about the data are invalid normality, independence, heteroskedacity, etc. often limited when it comes to statistical summaries and confidence intervals Solutions or alternatives when classical models fail Bayesian inference is a powerful, descriptive, and flexible modeling framework Bayes theorem is a simple model of incorporating prior information and data to produce a posterior probability or distribution \\(P(\\theta | X) \\propto P(X | \\theta) * P(\\theta)\\) or \\(posterior \\propto prior \\times likelihood\\) The prior is some distribution over the parameter space The likelihood is the probability of an outcome in the sample space given a value in the parameter space The posterior is the likelihood of values in the parameter space after observing values from the sample space Bayesian statistics, when described without math, actually feels natural to most people you hear hoof beats, you think horses, not zebras [unless you’re in Africa, but that’s prior information ;)] The catch is that the model is not complete as written above There is actually a denominator in Bayes’ Theorem \\(P(\\theta | X) = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\sum_i P(X | \\theta_i)} = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\int_\\Omega P(X | \\theta)d\\theta}\\) In general, the denominator is not known, or is not not easy (or possible) to calculate, but it always evaluates to a constant (hence the “proportional to”) The denominator acts as a scaling value that forces \\(P(\\theta|X)\\) to be a probability distribution (i.e. area under PDF is equal to 1) There are simulation-based techniques that let one approximate the posterior distribution without needing to know the analytic solution to the denominator I have organized this thesis as follows. In Chapter 2 I introduce the data set that drives the narrative and that motivates the adoption of Bayesian multilevel modeling. In Chapter 3 there is a review of common approaches approaches to modeling with psychometric data, and the benefits and drawbacks of such techniques. Chapter 4 introduces Bayesian hierarchical modeling and programming frameworks for Bayesian inference. In Chapter 5 I describe and work through a principled Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling. Chapter 6 goes into more depth on checking the model goodness of fit and model diagnostics in a Bayesian setting. Finally in Chapter 7 I demonstrate how to use the Bayesian model from the principled workflow for predictive inference, and use posterior predictive distributions to plot and compare models. "],
["motivating-data.html", "2 Background and Motivating Data 2.1 Psychometric Experiments 2.2 Temporal Order Judgment Data 2.3 Data Visualizations and Quirks", " 2 Background and Motivating Data It was Charles Darwin who in his book On the Origin of Species developed the idea that living organisms adapt to better survive in their environment. Sir Francis Galton, inspired by Darwin’s ideas, became interested in the differences in human beings and in how to measure those differences. Though the dark side of statistics and hubris lead Galton to become a pioneer of eugenics, his works on studying and measuring human differences lead to the creation of psychometrics – the science of measuring mental faculties. Around the same time that was developing his theories, Johann Friedrich Herbart was also interested in studying consciousness through the scientific method, and is responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind. E.H. Weber built upon Herbart’s work, and sought out to prove the idea of a psychological threshold. A psychological threshold is a minimum stimulus intensity necessary to activate a sensory system – a liminal stimulus. He paved the way for experimental psychology and is the namesake of Weber’s Law – the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus (Britannica 2014). \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{I} = k \\] To put this law into practice, consider holding a 1 kg weight (\\(I = 1\\)), and further suppose that we can just detect the difference between a 1 kg weight and a 1.2 kg weight (\\(\\Delta I = 0.2\\)). Then the constant just noticeable ratio is \\[ k = \\frac{0.2}{1} = 0.2 \\] So now if we pick up a 10 kg weight, we should be able to determine how much more mass is required to just detect a difference: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{10} = 0.2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta I = 2 \\] The difference between a 10 kg and a 12 kg weight should be just barely perceptible. Notice that the difference in the first set of weights is 0.2 and in the second set it is 2. Our perception of the difference in stimulus intensities is not absolute, but relative. G.T. Fechner devised the law (Weber-Fechner Law) that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. \\[S = K \\ln I\\] An example to this law is to consider two light sources, one that is 100 lumens (\\(S_1 = K \\ln 100\\)) and another that is 200 lumens (\\(S_2 = K \\ln 200\\)). The intensity of the second light is not perceived as twice as bright, but only about 1.15 times as bright according to the Weber-Fechner law: \\(\\theta = S_2 / S_1 \\approx 1.15\\). Notice that the value \\(K\\) cancels out when calculating the relative intensity, but knowing \\(K\\) can lead to important psychological insights; insights about differences between persons or groups of people! What biological and contextual factors affect how people perceive different stimuli? How do we measure their perception in a meaningful way? As one might expect, we can collect data from psychometric experiments, fit a model to the data from a family of functions called psychometric functions, and inspect key operating characteristics of those functions. 2.1 Psychometric Experiments Psychometric experiments are devised in a way to examine psychophysical processes, or the response between the world around us and our inward perceptions. A psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task (Wichmann and Hill 2001). Psychometric functions were studied as early as the late 1800’s, and Edwin Boring published a chart of the psychometric function in The American Journal of Psychology in 1917 (Boring 1917). Figure 2.1: A chart of the psychometric function. The experiment in this paper places two points on a subject’s skin separated by some distance, and has them answer their impression of whether there is one point or ‘two’, recorded as either ‘two’ or ‘not two’. As the separation of aesthesiometer points increases, so too does the subject’s confidence in their response of ‘two’. So at what separation is the impression of two points liminal? Figure 2.1 displays the key aspects of the psychometric function. The most crucial part is the sigmoid function, the S-like non-decreasing curve, which in this case is represented by the Normal CDF, \\(\\Phi(\\gamma)\\). The horizontal axis represents the stimulus stimulus intensity, the separation of two points in centimeters. The vertical axis represents the probability that a subject has the impression of two points. With only experimental data, the response proportion becomes an approximation for the probability. This leads me to talk about the type of psychometric experiment that this paper deals with called a temporal order judgment (TOJ) experiment. The concept is that if there are two distinct stimuli occurring nearly simultaneously then our brains will bind them into a single percept – perceive them as happening simultaneously. Compensation for small temporal differences is beneficial for coherent multisensory experiences, particularly in visual-speech synthesis as it is necessary to maintain an accurate representation of the sources of multisensory events. The temporal asynchrony between stimuli is called the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and the range of SOAs for which sensory signals are integrated into a global percept is called the temporal binding window. When the SOA grows too large then the brain segregates the two signals and the temporal order can be determined. Our experiences in life as we age shape the mechanisms of processing multisensory signals, and some multisensory signals are integrated much more readily than others. Perceptual synchrony has been previously studied through the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) – the temporal delay between two signals at which an observer is unsure about their temporal order (Stone et al. 2001). The temporal binding window is the time span over which sensory signals arising from different modalities appear integrated into a global percept. A deficit in temporal sensitivity may lead to a widening of the temporal binding window and reduce the ability to segregate unrelated sensory signals. In temporal order judgment tasks, the ability to discriminate the timing of multiple sensory signals is referred to as temporal sensitivity, and is studied through the measurement of the just noticeable difference (JND) – the smallest lapse in time so that a temporal order can just be determined. Figure 2.2 highlights the features through which we study psychometric functions. The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing (i.e. the response probability is 50%). The JND is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 84% level and the PSS, though the upper level depends on domain expertise. Figure 2.2: The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing. The just noticeable difference is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 0.84 level and the PSS, though the upper level depends on domain expertise. Perceptual synchrony and temporal sensitivity can be modified through a baseline understanding. In order to perceive physical events as simultaneous, our brains must adjust for differences in temporal delays of transmission of both psychical signals and sensory processing (Fujisaki et al. 2004). In some cases such as with audiovisual stimuli, the perception of simultaneity can be modified by repeatedly presenting the audiovisual stimuli at fixed time separations (called an adapter stimulus) to an observer (Vroomen et al. 2004). This repetition of presenting the adapter stimulus is called temporal recalibration. The data set that I introduce in the next section concerns temporal order judgment across various sensory modalities with a temporal recalibration component. 2.2 Temporal Order Judgment Data The data set that I am using in this paper comes from experiments done by A.N. Scurry and Dr. Fang Jiang in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. Reduced temporal sensitivity in the aging population manifests in an impaired ability to perceive synchronous events as simultaneous, and similarly more difficulty in segregating asynchronous sensory signals that belong to different sources. The consequences of a widening of the temporal binding window is considered in Scurry et al. (2019), as well as a complete detailing of the experimental setup and recording process. I provide a shortened summary of the methods. There are four different tasks in the experiment: audio-visual, visual-visual, visuo-motor, and duration, and I will refer to each task respectively as audiovisual, visual, sensorimotor, and duration. The participants consist of 15 young adults (age 20-27), 15 middle age adults (age 39-50), and 15 older adults (age 65-75), all recruited from the University of Nevada, Reno. Additionally all subjects are right handed and were reported to have normal or corrected to normal hearing and vision. Table 2.1: Sample of motivating data. soa response sid task trial age_group age sex -350 0 O-m-BC audiovisual pre older_adult 70 M -200 0 M-m-SJ duration post1 middle_age 48 M 28 1 O-f-KK sensorimotor pre older_adult 66 F 275 1 O-f-MW visual post1 older_adult 69 F In the audiovisual TOJ task, participants were asked to determine the temporal order between an auditory and visual stimulus. Stimulus onset asynchrony values were selected uniformly between -500 to +500 ms with 50 ms steps, where negative SOAs indicated that the visual stimulus was leading, and positive values indicated that the auditory stimulus was leading. Each SOA value was presented 5 times in random order in the initial block. At the end of each trial the subject was asked to report if the auditory stimulus came before the visual, where a \\(1\\) indicates that they perceived the sound first, and a \\(0\\) indicates that they perceived the visual stimulus first. A similar setup is repeated for the visual, sensorimotor, and duration tasks. The visual task presented two visual stimuli on the left and right side of a display with temporal asynchronies that varied between -300 ms to +300 ms with 25 ms steps. Negative SOAs indicated that the left stimulus was first, and positive that the right came first. A positive response indicates that the subject perceived the right stimulus first. The sensorimotor task has subjects focus on a black cross on a screen. When it disappears, they respond by pressing a button. Additionally, when the cross disappears, a visual stimulus was flashed on the screen, and subjects were asked if they perceived the visual stimulus before or after their button press. The latency of the visual stimulus was partially determined by individual subject’s average response time, so SOA values are not fixed between subjects and trials. A positive response indicates that the visual stimulus was perceived after the button press. The duration task presents two vertically stacked circles on a screen with one appearing right after the other. The top stimulus appeared for a fixed amount of time of 300 ms, and the bottom was displayed for anywhere between +100 ms to +500 ms in 50 ms steps corresponding to SOA values between -200 ms to +200 ms. The subject then responds to if they perceived the bottom circle as appearing longer than the top circle. Table 2.2: Summary of TOJ Tasks Task Positive Response Positive SOA Truth Audiovisual Perceived audio first Audio came before visual Visual Perceived right first Right came before left Sensorimotor Perceived visual first Visual came before tactile Duration Perceived bottom as longer Bottom lasted longer than top Finally, after the first block of each task was completed, the participants went through an adaptation period where they were presented with the respective stimuli from each task repeatedly at fixed temporal delays, then they repeated the task. To ensure that the adaptation affect persisted, the subject were presented with the adapter stimulus at regular intervals throughout the second block. The blocks are designated as pre and post1, post2, etc. in the data set. In this paper I will only be focusing on the pre and post1 blocks. 2.3 Data Visualizations and Quirks The dependent variable in these experiments is the perceived response which is encoded as a 0 or a 1, and the independent variable is the SOA value. If the response is plotted against the SOA values, then it is difficult to determine any relationship (see figure 2.3). Transparency can be used to better visualize the relationships between SOA value and responses. The center plot in figure 2.3 uses the same data as the left plot, except that the transparency is set to 0.05. As a result, one can see that there is a higher density of “0” responses towards more negative SOAs, and a higher density of “1” responses for more positive SOAs. Taking it a step further, I can compute and plot the proportion of responses for a given SOA. This is displayed in the right plot. Now the relationship between SOA value and responses is clear – as the SOA value goes from more negative to more positive, the proportion of positive responses increases from near 0 to near 1. Figure 2.3: Left: Simple plot of response vs. soa value. Center: A plot of response vs. soa with transparency. Right: A plot of proportions vs. soa with transparency. Subjectively the right plot in figure 2.3 is the easiest to interpret. Because of this, I will often present the observed and predicted data using the proportion of responses rather than the actual response. Proportional data also has the advantage of being bounded on the same interval as the response. For the audiovisual task, the responses can be aggregated into binomial data – the number of positive responses for given SOA value – which is sometimes more efficient to work with than the Bernoulli data (see table 2.3). However the number of times an SOA is presented varies between the pre-adaptation and post-adaptation blocks; 5 and 3 times per SOA respectively. Table 2.3: Audiovisual task with aggregated responses. trial soa n k proportion pre 200 5 4 0.80 150 5 5 1.00 -350 5 0 0.00 post1 350 3 3 1.00 -500 3 1 0.33 -200 3 0 0.00 Other quirks about the data pertain to the subjects. There is one younger subject that did not complete the audiovisual task, and one younger subject that did not complete the duration task. Additionally there is one older subject who’s response data for the post-adaptation audiovisual task is unreasonable1 (see figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Post-adaptation response data for O-f-CE It is unreasonable because, of all the negative SOAs, there were only two correct responses2. If a ssubject is randomly guessing the temporal order, then a naive estimate for the proportion of correct responses is 0.5. If a subject’s proportion of correct responses is above 0.5, then they are doing better than random guessing. In figure 2.5 it is seen that subject O-f-CE is the only one who’s proportion is below 0.5 (and by a considerable amount). Figure 2.5: Proportion of correct responses for negative SOA values during the post-adaptation audiovisual experiment. The consequences of leaving in this experimental block in the data is considered in the Chapter 5, but it is a clear outlier that must be noted. When this method of detecting outliers is repeated for all tasks and blocks, then I end up with 17 records in total (see figure 2.6), one of which is the aforementioned subject. Figure 2.6: Proportion of correct responses across all tasks and blocks Proportions are calculated individually for positive and negative SOAs. Most of the records that are flagged by this method of outlier detection are from the sensorimotor task, and none are from the visual task. This may be caused by the perceived difficulty of the task. One consequence of higher temporal sensitivity is that it is easier to determine temporal order. It may also be that determining temporal order is inherently easier for certain multisensory tasks than others. Since the sensorimotor task does not have fixed SOA values like the other tasks, it may be perceived as more difficult. Or perhaps the mechanisms that process touch and visual signals are not as well coupled as those that process audio and visual signals. I’ll consider how to handle the sensorimotor outliers in the model fitting process. References "],
["background.html", "3 Background to Modeling", " 3 Background to Modeling A psychometric function can be fit using a generalized linear model (GLM) with the link function coming from the family of S-shaped curves called a sigmoid. Commonly GLMs are fit using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In the case of a psychometric experiment, we can represent the outcome of a single trial as the result of a random experiment arising from a Bernoulli process. Without loss of generality, the psychometric function, \\(F(x; \\theta)\\), determines the probability that the outcome is 1. \\[\\begin{align*} Y &amp;\\sim \\textrm{Bernoulli}(\\pi) \\\\ \\pi &amp;= P(Y=1 \\vert x; \\theta) = F(x; \\theta) \\end{align*}\\] If \\(P(Y=1 | x; \\theta) = F(x;\\theta)\\), then \\(P(Y = 0 | x; \\theta) = 1 - F(x;\\theta)\\), and hence the probability of an outcome is \\[\\begin{equation} P(Y=y | x; \\theta) = F(x;\\theta)^y(1-F(x;\\theta))^{1-y} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] The likelihood function, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), can be determined using equation (3.1) \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{split} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta | y, x) &amp;= \\prod_{i}^{N} P(y_i | x_i; \\theta) \\\\ &amp;= \\prod_{i}^{N}F(x_i;\\theta)^{y_i}(1-F(x_i;\\theta))^{1-y_i} \\end{split} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (3.2) is commonly expressed in terms of its logarithm. \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\theta | y, x) = \\sum_{i}^{N} y_i \\ln\\left(F(x_i;\\theta)\\right) + (1-y_i) \\ln\\left(F(x_i;\\theta))\\right) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] From here the classical approach would be to take the derivative of (3.3), set it equal to \\(0\\), and solve for \\(\\theta\\). Additionally one might perform a second derivative test to ensure that the solution is indeed a maximizer to (3.3) (and hence to (3.2)). However no closed form expression exists for the solution to \\(\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\ln \\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = 0\\), and so numerical optimization methods like gradient descent are used to iteratively find the MLE solution. In most cases this works fine, but there are common situations where MLE fails. In this chapter I will discuss common techniques for fitting psychometric functions, the reasons to use these methods, and the conditions for when they are not optimal. As introduced above, the first method is to use generalized linear models. A GLM is one that can be transformed into a linear model via a link function. An example of this is the logistic function which takes \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and squishes the output to be in \\((0, 1)\\). \\[\\begin{equation} F(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\theta\\right)} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] Since \\(F\\) is a strictly increasing and continuous function, it has an inverse, and the link for (3.4) is the log-odds or logit function. \\[\\begin{equation} F^{-1}(\\pi) = \\mathrm{logit}(\\pi) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi}\\right) \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] By taking \\((F^{-1} \\circ F)(\\theta)\\) we can arrive at a relationship that is linear in \\(\\theta\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\pi = F(\\theta) \\Longleftrightarrow F^{-1}(\\pi) &amp;= F^{-1}(F(\\theta)) \\\\ &amp; = \\ln\\left(\\frac{F(\\theta)}{1 - F(\\theta)}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\ln(F(\\theta)) - \\ln(1 - F(\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\theta)}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta)}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= - \\ln(1 + \\exp(-\\theta)) - \\ln(\\exp(-\\theta)) + \\ln(1 + \\exp(-\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= - \\ln(\\exp(-\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= \\theta \\end{align*}\\] Linear models are favored in statistics because they are generally easier to interpret than other types of models. For example, say \\(\\mathrm{logit}(\\pi) = 0.5 + 1.5x\\) where \\(\\pi\\) is the probability of a positive outcome, \\(Y=1\\). We can say that at \\(x = 0\\), the log-odds of a positive outcome is 0.5, and an increase in \\(x\\) by 1 increases the log-odds by 1.5. There is nothing that is particular about the logistic function that makes it the only suitable sigmoid for psychometric functions. Other common link functions include the probit (inverse of the standard normal CDF) and Weibull inverse CDF. In fact, any continuous CDF defined on the real number line can be used for psychometric functions. A PF only requires that a function is strictly increasing and bounded between 0 and 1.The logit and probit links have properties such as connections to log-odds and the normal distribution that make working with them more convenient. Generalized Linear Models classical approaches to fitting/estimation Maximum likelihood estimation Simple and almost every piece of statistical software will have an implementation Expectation Maximization Random effects (Gelmen and Hill) Bayesian GLMs Completely reliant on MCMC Model-free estimations (footnote? remark?) non-parametric models (Zchaluk and Foster 2009) Bayesian logistic regression Gelman et al. (2008) Can’t completely express the structure (hierarchy) of the data Residual Analysis using the fitted values vs. the observed values to evaluate goodness of fit So what’s the answer? The last two options (bayes + multilevel) when on their own do well, but are not robust to shortcomings Convergence failure in the presence of complete separation (Prins 2019), (Ghosh et al. 2018) Give an example with how the MLE values are estimated Give an example where MLE fails References "],

The problem is that many of these prescriptions are given without context for when they are appropriate to be taken. According to Betancourt (2020), this leaves “practitioners to piece together their own model building workflows from potentially incomplete or even inconsistent heuristics.” The concept of a principled workflow is that for any given problem, there is not, nor should there be, a default set of steps to take to get from data exploration to predictive inferences. Rather great consideration must be given to domain expertise and the questions that one is trying to answer with the data. Since everyone asks different questions, the value of a model is not in how well it ticks the boxes of goodness-of-fit checks, but in consistent it is with domain expertise and its ability to answer the unique set of questions. Betancourt suggests answering four questions to evaluate a model by: Domain Expertise Consistency - Is our model consistent with our domain expertise? Computational Faithfulness - Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors? Inferential Adequacy - Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions?
