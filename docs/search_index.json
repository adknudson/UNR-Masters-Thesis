Knudson December, 2020 1 Introduction With the advances in computational power and high-level programming languages like Python, R, and Julia, statistical methods have evolved to be more flexible and expressive. No longer must we be subjugated by p-values and step-wise regression techniques. Gone are the days of using clever modeling techniques to tame misbehaved data. Now is the time for principled and informed decisions to create bespoke models and domain-motivated analyses. We have the shoulders of giants to stand upon and look out at the vast sea of data science. I want to talk about how the advances in computational power have lead to a sort of mini revolution - resurrection - in statistics where Bayesian modeling has gained an incredible following thanks to projects like Stan. The steady adoption of computer aided statistical workflows also brings the need for multidisciplinary techniques from numerical analysis, probability theory, statistics, computer science, visualizations, and more. And with the age of computers, there is a strong push towards reproducibility. Concepts of modular design, workflows, project history and versioning, virtual environments, and human readable code all contribute to reproducible analyses. And somehow I also want to tie in how data is immutable - raw data should (must) be treated as a constant and unchangeable entity, and merely touching it will cause data mitosis. I will now segue into introducing the intent of this paper. I believe that utilizing the computational ability of modern computers helps strengthen the validity of an analysis. This is achieved by using powerful but expressive tools like Stan to write models that visually match written mathematical models. Classical statistical tools, while fast, require clever mathematics to perform certain routines such as fitting mixed effects models or the interpretation of cryptic p-values to determine if a model is “good”. Instead I believe we should be moving towards probabilistic programming languages like Stan to carry out Statistical analyses. This paper is motivated by an experiment in psychometrics (chapter 2), and by highlighting a principled workflow I seek to convince the reader that Bayesian multilevel modeling should be the default tool for modeling psychometric experiments. In the next section of this introduction, I will list classical tools for statistical modeling [of psychometric experiments] and touch on the limitations of such tools. Following that section, I will introduce the methods I use for building a model that deviate from classical methods. 1.1 Everything can be Blamed on Fisher … or Pearson, or Gauss, or … When I hear the term “regression”, I instantly think about maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters. And why not? There is an endless wealth of literature on the subject of linear regression and MLE (Johnson, Wichern, and others 2002; Larsen and Marx 2005; Sheather 2009; Navidi 2015). Most introductory courses on statistics and regression center around classical techniques such as MLE, hypothesis testing, and residual analysis. For the common student, learning statistical modeling in classical way can feel sterilized and mechanic. Check that the data are normal. Check that the coefficients are significantly different from zero. Check that the residuals are normal. Etc. I’m not trying to say that these methods are not important or that they are deeply flawed - it would be bad for modern society if we were just now finding out that the models are wrong. Instead, I am arguing that because they are so common and easy to apply that they are used without much extra thought. Take variable selection as an example. In a data set where there are a dozen predictors, how does one go about selecting which parameters produce the best model? Without thought, one may reach for a step-wise selection algorithm, and confidently conclude that variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are significant because the p-values say so. This method does fall apart quickly because as the number of parameters grow, so too does the number of steps needed to find the best subset of variables1, and there is no guarantee that the algorithm actually selects the best2 subset. But even if the best subset of variables is found, one still needs to consider if the variables have a practical effect or if the model omitted an important variable of interest. Sure, the type of analysis is important to the techniques used. Variable selection through step-wise algorithms or penalized maximum likelihood estimation (Hoerl and Kennard 1970; Tibshirani 1996) may be appropriate in an exploratory data analysis, but improper for causal inference and other scientifically motivated experiments. Which brings me to talk next about p-values, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. The concept of basing scientific results on the falsifiability (Popper 1959) or refutability of a claim is a strong foundation for the scientific method, and is arguably much better than the previous grounds of verifiability – just because something has been true for a very long time, doesn’t mean it will always be true in the future. But hypothesis testing comes with its own set of problems. Null hypothesis testing for point estimates usually depends on calculating a confidence interval and seeing if the interval contains the point of interest. This can be misleading, as there is more than one confidence interval that can be calculated. For Gaussian distributions, the mean equals the median equals the mode, so a 95% confidence interval is evenly distributed around the central measures. Some distributions are skewed, so an equal tail area confidence interval might not necessarily include the most likely value. Take for example the exponential distribution \\[ X \\sim \\mathrm{exponential} (\\lambda) \\] An equal tail area 95% confidence interval would be \\(\\left(-\\ln(0.975)/\\lambda, -\\ln(0.025)/\\lambda\\right)\\) which would not even contain the most likely value of zero. Should the highest density interval be used? Should skewness be reported with p-values and confidence intervals? Furthermore, confidence intervals are conditional on the model chosen, and that introduces other problems. McElreath (2020) discusses a well-known issue in population biology about comparing a neutral model of the distribution of allele frequencies to a selective model. In short, the two differing hypotheses may suggest different process models which in turn lead to statistical models - some of which are shared by both hypotheses. Rejecting the statistical model doesn’t rule out either of the hypotheses. Should we scrap these principles and tools all together? Absolutely not. Most of these wrinkled problems (and others) have been talked about and ironed out through careful discussion and clever techniques, but the damage is done, and hypothesis testing and p-values are widely misunderstood and misused. The problem is that these techniques rest on having a strong foundation of statistical knowledge, both to produce and to properly understand. This requirement is stifling. Communicating statistical results is just as important as producing them, and with modern tools and a vast selection of expressive languages we can analyze data in a more intuitive and natural framework. 1.2 Proposal of New Methods In my biased opinion, the Bayesian framework for modeling is a much more natural way to conduct scientific research where some kind of data analysis is involved. Now of course, I can’t claim as such without some compelling argument or examples. I have already targeted some weak points of classical statistics, and throughout Chapter 3 I will highlight specific examples of where classical techniques are typically applied, and how they may fall short compared to my proposal methods. What I am proposing is a fully Bayesian workflow to build and analyze a statistical model. In this Bayesian workflow (which shall hence be referred to simply as “workflow”) I will highlight a set of principles that utilize domain expertise, and focus around building a multilevel model. My goal is to show that the combination of these two concepts yields better prediction results and greater inferential power. And in lieu of p-values and hypothesis testing, I let predictive inference narrate the statistical results and strength of association within the model. 1.3 Organization I have organized this thesis as follows. In Chapter 2 I introduce the data set that drives the narrative and that motivates the adoption of Bayesian multilevel modeling. In Chapter 3 I describe and work through a principled Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling. Chapter 4 goes into more depth on checking the model goodness of fit and model diagnostics in a Bayesian setting. In Chapter 5 I demonstrate how to use the Bayesian model from the principled workflow for predictive inference, and use posterior predictive distributions to plot and compare models. Chapters 5 and 6 go over the quantitative results and discuss the qualitative choices in the workflow. Then I conclude this paper in Chapter 7. References "],["motivating-data.html", "2 What is a Model without Data 2.1 Psychometric Experiments 2.2 Temporal Order Judgment Data 2.3 Data Visualizations and Quirks", " 2 What is a Model without Data What is data without a model It was Charles Darwin who in his book On the Origin of Species developed the idea that living organisms adapt in order to better survive in their environment. Sir Francis Galton, inspired by Darwin’s ideas, became interested in the differences in human beings and in how to measure those differences. Though the dark side of statistics and hubris lead Galton to become a pioneer of eugenics, his works on studying and measuring human differences lead to the creation of psychometrics – the science of measuring mental faculties. Around the same time that he was developing his theories, Johann Friedrich Herbart was also interested in studying consciousness through the scientific method, and is responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind. E.H. Weber built upon Herbart’s work, and sought out to prove the idea of a psychological threshold. A psychological threshold is a minimum stimulus intensity necessary to activate a sensory system – a liminal stimulus. He paved the way for experimental psychology and is the namesake of Weber’s Law – the change in a stimulus that will be just noticeable is a constant ratio of the original stimulus (Britannica 2014). \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{I} = k \\] To put this law into practice, consider holding a 1 kg weight (\\(I = 1\\)), and further suppose that we can just detect the difference between a 1 kg weight and a 1.2 kg weight (\\(\\Delta I = 0.2\\)). Then the constant just noticeable ratio is \\[ k = \\frac{0.2}{1} = 0.2 \\] So now if we pick up a 10 kg weight, we should be able to determine how much more mass is required to just detect a difference: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta I}{10} = 0.2 \\Rightarrow \\Delta I = 2 \\] The difference between a 10 kg and a 12 kg weight should be just barely perceptible. Notice that the difference in the first set of weights is 0.2 and in the second set it is 2. Our perception of the difference in stimulus intensities is not absolute, but relative. G.T. Fechner devised the law (Weber-Fechner Law) that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. \\[S = K \\ln I\\] An example to this law is to consider two light sources, one that is 100 lumens (\\(S_1 = K \\ln 100\\)) and another that is 200 lumens (\\(S_2 = K \\ln 200\\)). The intensity of the second light is not perceived as twice as bright, but only about 1.15 times as bright according to the Weber-Fechner law. \\[\\theta = S_2 / S_1 \\approx 1.15\\] Notice that the value \\(K\\) cancels out when calculating the relative intensity, but knowing \\(K\\) can lead to important psychological insights; insights about differences between persons or groups of people! What biological and contextual factors affect how people perceive different stimuli? How do we measure their perception in a meaningful way? As one might expect, we can collect data from psychometric experiments, fit a model to the data from a family of functions called psychometric functions, and inspect key operating characteristics of those functions. 2.1 Psychometric Experiments Psychometric experiments are devised in a way to examine psychophysical processes, or the response between the world around us and our inward perceptions. A psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task (Wichmann and Hill 2001). Psychometric functions were studied as early as the late 1800’s, and Edwin Boring published a chart of the psychometric function in The American Journal of Psychology in 1917 (Boring 1917). Figure 2.1: A chart of the psychometric function. The experiment in this paper places two points on a subject’s skin separated by some distance, and has them answer their impression of whether there is one point or two, recorded as either ‘two points’ or ‘not two points’. As the separation of aesthesiometer points increases, so too does the subject’s confidence in their perception of ‘two-ness’. So at what separation is the impression of two points liminal? Figure 2.1 displays the key aspects of the psychometric function. The most crucial part is the sigmoid function, the S-like non-decreasing curve which in this case is represented by the Normal CDF, \\(\\Phi(\\gamma)\\). The horizontal axis represents the stimulus stimulus intensity, the separation of two points in centimeters. The vertical axis represents the probability that a subject has the impression of two points. With only experimental data, the response proportion becomes an approximation for the probability. This leads me to talk about the type of psychometric experiment that this paper deals with called a temporal order judgment (TOJ) experiment. The concept is that if there are two distinct stimuli occurring nearly simultaneously then our brains will bind them into a single percept (perceive them as happening simultaneously). Compensation for small temporal differences is beneficial for coherent multisensory experiences, particularly in visual-speech synthesis as it is necessary to maintain an accurate representation of the sources of multisensory events. The temporal asynchrony between stimuli is called the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and the range of SOAs for which sensory signals are integrated into a global percept is called the temporal binding window. When the SOA grows too large then the brain segregates the two signals and the temporal order can be determined. Our experiences in life as we age shape the mechanisms of processing multisensory signals, and some multisensory signals are integrated much more readily than others. Perceptual synchrony has been previously studied through the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS) – the temporal delay between two signals at which an observer is unsure about their temporal order (Stone et al. 2001). The temporal binding window is the time span over which sensory signals arising from different modalities appear integrated into a global percept. A deficit in temporal sensitivity may lead to a widening of the temporal binding window and reduce the ability to segregate unrelated sensory signals. In temporal order judgment tasks, the ability to discriminate the timing of multiple sensory signals is referred to as temporal sensitivity, and is studied through the measurement of the just noticeable difference (JND) – the smallest lapse in time so that a temporal order can just be determined. Figure 2.2 highlights the features through which we study psychometric functions. The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing (i.e. the response probability is 50%). The JND is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 84% level3 and the PSS, though the upper level often depends on domain expertise. Figure 2.2: The PSS is defined as the point where an observer can do no better at determining temporal order than random guessing. The just noticeable difference is defined as the extra temporal delay between stimuli so that the temporal order is just able to be determined. Historically this has been defined as the difference between the 0.84 level and the PSS, though the upper level depends on domain expertise. Perceptual synchrony and temporal sensitivity can be modified through a baseline understanding. In order to perceive physical events as simultaneous, our brains must adjust for differences in temporal delays of transmission of both psychical signals and sensory processing (Fujisaki et al. 2004). In some cases such as with audiovisual stimuli, the perception of simultaneity can be modified by repeatedly presenting the audiovisual stimuli at fixed time separations (called an adapter stimulus) to an observer (Vroomen et al. 2004). This repetition of presenting the adapter stimulus is called temporal recalibration. The data set that I introduce in the next section concerns temporal order judgment across various sensory modalities with a temporal recalibration component. 2.2 Temporal Order Judgment Data Which came first, the chicken or the experimentally controlled stimulus The data set that I am using in this paper comes from experiments done by A.N. Scurry and Dr. F. Jiang in the Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada. Reduced temporal sensitivity in the aging population manifests in an impaired ability to perceive synchronous events as simultaneous, and similarly more difficulty in segregating asynchronous sensory signals that belong to different sources. The consequences of a widening of the temporal binding window is considered in Scurry et al. (2019), as well as a complete detailing of the experimental setup and recording process. A shortened summary of the methods is provided below. There are four different tasks in the experiment: audio-visual, visual-visual, visual-motor, and duration, and I will refer to each task respectively as audiovisual, visual, sensorimotor, and duration. The participants consist of 15 young adults (age 20-27), 15 middle age adults (age 39-50), and 15 older adults (age 65-75), all recruited from the University of Nevada, Reno. Additionally all subjects are right handed and were reported to have normal or corrected to normal hearing and vision. Table 2.1: Sample of motivating data. soa response sid task trial age_group age sex -350 0 O-m-BC audiovisual pre older_adult 70 M -200 0 M-m-SJ duration post1 middle_age 48 M 28 1 O-f-KK sensorimotor pre older_adult 66 F 275 1 O-f-MW visual post1 older_adult 69 F In the audiovisual TOJ task, participants were asked to determine the temporal order between an auditory and visual stimulus. Stimulus onset asynchrony values were selected uniformly between -500 to +500 ms with 50 ms steps, where negative SOAs indicated that the visual stimulus was leading, and positive values indicated that the auditory stimulus was leading. Each SOA value was presented 5 times in random order in the initial block. At the end of each trial the subject was asked to report if the auditory stimulus came before the visual, where a \\(1\\) indicates that they perceived the sound first, and a \\(0\\) indicates that they perceived the visual stimulus first. A similar setup is repeated for the visual, sensorimotor, and duration tasks. The visual task presented two visual stimuli on the left and right side of a display with temporal asynchronies that varied between -300 ms to +300 ms with 25 ms steps. Negative SOAs indicated that the left stimulus was first, and positive that the right came first. A positive response indicates that the subject perceived the right stimulus first. The sensorimotor task has subjects focus on a black cross on a screen. When it disappears, they respond by pressing a button. Additionally, when the cross disappears, a visual stimulus was flashed on the screen, and subjects were asked if they perceived the visual stimulus before or after their button press. The latency of the visual stimulus was partially determined by individual subject’s average response time, so SOA values are not fixed between subjects and trials. A positive response indicates that the visual stimulus was perceived after the button press. The duration task presents two vertically stacked circles on a screen with one appearing right after the other. The top stimulus appeared for a fixed amount of time of 300 ms, and the bottom was displayed for anywhere between +100 ms to +500 ms in 50 ms steps corresponding to SOA values between -200 ms to +200 ms. The subject then responds to if they perceived the bottom circle as appearing longer than the top circle. Table 2.2: Summary of TOJ Tasks Task Positive Response Positive SOA Truth Audiovisual Perceived audio first Audio came before visual Visual Perceived right first Right came before left Sensorimotor Perceived visual first Visual came before tactile Duration Perceived bottom as longer Bottom lasted longer than top Finally, after the first block of each task was completed, the participants went through an adaptation period where they were presented with the respective stimuli from each task repeatedly at fixed temporal delays, then they repeated the task. To ensure that the adaptation affect persisted, the subject were presented with the adapter stimulus at regular intervals throughout the second block. The blocks are designated as pre and post1, post2, etc. in the data set. In this paper I will only be focusing on the pre and post1 blocks. 2.3 Data Visualizations and Quirks The dependent variable in these experiments is the perceived response which is encoded as a 0 or a 1, and the independent variable is the SOA value. If the response is plotted against the SOA values, then it is difficult to determine any relationship (see figure 2.3). Transparency can be used to better visualize the relationships between SOA value and responses. The center plot in figure 2.3 uses the same data as the left plot, except that the transparency is set to 0.05. As a result, one can see that there is a higher density of “0” responses towards more negative SOAs, and a higher density of “1” responses for more positive SOAs. Taking it a step further, I can compute and plot the proportion of responses for a given SOA. This is displayed in the right panel. Now the relationship between SOA values and responses is clear – as the SOA value goes from more negative to more positive, the proportion of positive responses increases from near 0 to near 1. Figure 2.3: Left: Simple plot of response vs. soa value. Center: A plot of response vs. soa with transparency. Right: A plot of proportions vs. soa with transparency. Subjectively the right plot in figure 2.3 is the easiest to interpret. Because of this, I will often present the observed and predicted data using the proportion of responses rather than the actual response. Proportional data also has the advantage of being bounded on the same interval as the response. For the audiovisual task, the responses can be aggregated into binomial data – the number of positive responses for given SOA value – which is sometimes more efficient to work with than the Bernoulli data (see table 2.3). However the number of times an SOA is presented varies between the pre-adaptation and post-adaptation blocks; 5 and 3 times per SOA respectively. Table 2.3: Audiovisual task with aggregated responses. trial soa n k proportion pre 200 5 4 0.80 150 5 5 1.00 -350 5 0 0.00 post1 350 3 3 1.00 -500 3 1 0.33 -200 3 0 0.00 Other quirks about the data pertain to the subjects. There is one younger subject that did not complete the audiovisual task, and one younger subject that did not complete the duration task. Additionally there is one older subject who’s response data for the post-adaptation audiovisual task is unreasonable4 (see figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Post-adaptation response data for O-f-CE It is unreasonable because, of all the negative SOAs, there were only two correct responses5. If a subject is randomly guessing the temporal order, then a naive estimate for the proportion of correct responses is 0.5. If a subject’s proportion of correct responses is above 0.5, then they are doing better than random guessing. In figure 2.5 it is seen that subject O-f-CE is the only one who’s proportion is below 0.5 (and by a considerable amount). Figure 2.5: Proportion of correct responses for negative SOA values during the post-adaptation audiovisual experiment. The consequences of leaving in this experimental block in the data is considered in the Chapter 6, but it is a clear outlier that must be noted. When this method of detecting outliers is repeated for all tasks and blocks, then I end up with 17 records in total (see figure 2.6), one of which is the aforementioned subject. Figure 2.6: Proportion of correct responses across all tasks and blocks Proportions are calculated individually for positive and negative SOAs. Most of the records that are flagged by this method of outlier detection are from the sensorimotor task, and none are from the visual task. This may be attributed to the perceived difficulty of the task. One consequence of higher temporal sensitivity is that it is easier to determine temporal order. It may also be that determining temporal order is inherently easier for certain multisensory tasks compared to others. Since the sensorimotor task does not have fixed SOA values like the other tasks, it may be perceived as more difficult. Or perhaps the mechanisms that process tactile and visual signals are not as well coupled as those that process audio and visual signals. Once again, I’ll consider the handling of the sensorimotor outliers in the results chapter. Now that I have introduced the motivating data and some of the theory behind psychometric experiments, I am ready to introduce a Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling of the psychometric function. If the reader is interested in a fun story, in the discussion chapter I talk about the process I went through to read in this psychometric data, clean it up, and produce a tidy data set that is ready for modeling. While data cleaning and transforming is a topic entirely to itself, it is not the main focus of this paper.

I was hoping to build up the suspense. Well I hope you’re now ready for the answer. A principled Bayesian workflow is a method of employing domain expertise and statistical knowledge to iteratively build a statistical model that satisfies the constraints and goals set forth by the researcher. Oh, and Bayesian techniques are used in exchange for classical ones. Maybe not worth the suspense, but the simple idea spawns a creative and descriptive way to analyze data. What about the multilevel aspect? While I get into that more in the following sections, the concept is simple. Multilevel models should be the default. The alternatives are models with complete pooling, or models with no pooling. Pooling vs. no pooling is a fancy way of saying that all the data is modeled as a whole, or the smallest component (group) is modeled individually. The former implies that the variation between groups is zero (all groups are the same), and the latter implies that the variation between groups is infinite (no groups are the same). Multilevel models assume that the truth is somewhere in the middle of zero and infinity. That’s not a difficult thing to posit. Hierarchical models are a specific kind of multilevel model where one or more groups are nested within a larger one. In the case of the psychometric data, there are three age groups, and within each age group are individual subjects. Multilevel modeling provides a way to quantify and apportion the variation within the data to each level in the model. For an in-depth introduction to multilevel modeling, see Gelman and Hill (2006). There are many great resources out there for following along with an analysis of some data or problem, and much more is the abundance of tips, tricks, techniques, and testimonies to good modeling practices. The problem is that many of these prescriptions are given without context for when they are appropriate to be taken. According to Betancourt (2020), this leaves “practitioners to piece together their own model building workflows from potentially incomplete or even inconsistent heuristics.” The concept of a principled workflow is that for any given problem, there is not, nor should there be, a default set of steps to take to get from data exploration to predictive inferences. Rather great consideration must be given to domain expertise and the questions that one is trying to answer with the data. Since everyone asks different questions, the value of a model is not in how well it ticks the boxes of goodness-of-fit checks, but in how consistent it is with domain expertise and its ability to answer the unique set of questions. Betancourt suggests answering four questions to evaluate a model by: Domain Expertise Consistency - Is our model consistent with our domain expertise? Computational Faithfulness - Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors? Inferential Adequacy - Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions? Model Adequacy - Is our model rich enough to capture the relevant structure of the true data generating process? Like any good Bayesian6, much work is done before seeing the data or building a model. This may include talking with experts to gain domain knowledge or to elicit priors. Experts may know something about a particular measure, perhaps the mean or variability of the data from years of research, and different experts may provide different estimates of a measure. The benefit of modeling in a Bayesian framework is that all prior knowledge may be incorporated into the model to be used to estimate the posterior distribution. The same prior knowledge may also be used to check the posterior to ensure that predictions remain within physical or expert-given constraints. Consistency is key. The computational tool I will be using to estimate the posterior is a probabilistic programming language (PPL) called Stan (Guo et al. 2020) within the R programming language. Stan uses the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). For a gentle introduction to Bayesian statistics and sampling methods, see Bolstad and Curran (2016), and for an in-depth review of HMC see Betancourt (2017). Why do we need a sampler at all? Bayesian statistics and modeling stems from Bayes theorem (Equation (3.1)). The prior \\(P(\\theta)\\) is some distribution over the parameter space and the likelihood \\(P(X | \\theta)\\) is the probability of an outcome in the sample space given a value in the parameter space. To keep things simple, we generally say that the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood. Why proportional? The posterior distribution is a probability distribution, which means that the sum or integral over the parameter space must evaluate to one. Because of this constraint, the denominator in (3.1) acts as a scale factor to ensure that the posterior is valid. Often it happens that the integral in the denominator is complex or of a high dimension. In the former situation, the integral may not be possible to evaluate, and in the latter there may not be enough computational resources in the world to perform a simple grid approximation. \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\theta | X) = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\sum_i P(X | \\theta_i)} = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\int_\\Omega P(X | \\theta)d\\theta} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] The solution is to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The idea is that we can draw samples from the posterior distribution in a way that samples proportionally to the density. This sampling is a form of approximation to the area under the curve (i.e. an approximation to the denominator in (3.1)). Rejection sampling (Gilks and Wild 1992) and slice sampling (Neal 2003) are basic methods for sampling from a target distribution, however they can often be inefficient7. NUTS is a much more complex algorithm that can be compared to a physics simulation. A massless “particle” is flicked in a random direction with some amount of kinetic energy in a probability field, and is stopped randomly. The stopping point is the new proposal sample. The No U-Turn part means that when the algorithm detects that the particle is turning around, it will stop so as not to return to the starting position. This sampling scheme has a much higher rate of accepted samples, and also comes with many built-in diagnostic tools that let us know when the sampler is having trouble efficiently exploring the posterior. I’ll talk more about these diagnostic tools throughout the remaining sections and in chapter 4. The question of inferential adequacy depends on the set of questions that we are seeking to answer with the data from the psychometric experiment. The broad objective is to determine if there are any significant differences between age groups when it comes to temporal sensitivity, perceptual synchrony, and temporal recalibration, and if the task influences the results as well. The specific goals are to estimate and compare the PSS an JND across all age groups, conditions, and tasks, and determine the affect of recalibration between age groups. For the last question, model adequacy, I will be following a set of steps proposed in Betancourt (2020). The purpose of laying out these steps is not to again blindly check them off, but to force the analyst to carefully consider each point and make an informed decision whether the step is necessary or to craft the specifics of how the step should be completed. The steps are listed in table 3.1. These steps are also not meant to be followed linearly. If at any point it is discovered that there is an issue in conceptual understanding or model adequacy or something else, then it is encouraged to go back to a previous step and start with a new understanding. Table 3.1: Principled workflow Part Step Pre-Model, Pre-Data conceptual analysis define observational space construct summary statistics Post-Model, Pre-Data develop model construct summary functions simulate Bayesian ensemble prior checks configure algorithm fit simulated ensemble algorithmic calibration inferential calibration Post-Model, Post-Data fit observed data diagnose posterior fit posterior retrodictive checks celebrate I’ll talk about each step in the first iteration, but may choose to omit steps in subsequent iterations if there are no changes. For the purposes of building a model and being concise, I will focus around the audiovisual TOJ task in this chapter, but the final model will apply similarly to the visual and duration tasks. For the sensorimotor task, the model will be modified to accept Bernoulli data as apposed to aggregated Binomial counts (described more in the next section). 3.1 Iteration 1 (journey of a thousand miles) Pre-Model, Pre-Data I begin the modeling process by modeling the experiment according to the description of how it occurred and how the data were collected. This first part consists of conceptual analysis, defining the observational space, and constructing summary statistics that can help us to identify issues in the model specification. Conceptual Analysis In section 2.2 I discussed the experimental setup and data collection. To reiterate, subjects are presented with two stimuli separated by some temporal delay, and they are asked to respond as to their perception of the temporal order. There are 45 subjects with 15 each in the young, middle, and older age groups. As the SOA becomes larger in the positive direction, subjects are expected to give more “positive” responses, and as the SOA becomes larger in the negative direction, more “negative” responses are expected. By the way the experiment and responses are constructed, there is no expectation to see a reversal of this trend unless there was an issue with the subject’s understanding of the directions given to them or an error in the recording device. After the first experimental block the subjects go through a recalibration period, and repeat the experiment again. The interest is in seeing if the recalibration has an effect on temporal sensitivity and perceptual synchrony, and if the effect is different for each age group. Define Observational Space The response that subjects give during a TOJ task is recorded as a zero or a one (see section 2.2), and their relative performance is determined by the SOA value. Let \\(y\\) represent the binary outcome of a trial and let \\(x\\) be the SOA value. \\[\\begin{align*} y_i &amp;\\in \\lbrace 0, 1\\rbrace \\\\ x_i &amp;\\in \\mathbb{R} \\end{align*}\\] If the SOA values are fixed like in the audiovisual task, then the responses can be aggregated into binomial counts, \\(k\\). \\[ k_i, n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_0^+, k_i \\le n_i \\] In the above expression, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_0^+\\) represents the set of non-negative integers. Notice that the number of trials \\(n\\) has an index variable \\(i\\). This is because the number of trials per SOA is not fixed between blocks. In the pre-adaptation block, there are five trials per SOA compared to three in the post-adaptation block. So if observation 32 is recorded during a “pre” block, \\(n_{32} = 5\\), and if observation 1156 is during a “post” block, \\(n_{1156} = 3\\). Of course this is assuming that each subject completed all trials in the block, but the flexibility of the indexing can manage even if they didn’t. Then there are also three categorical variables – age group, subject ID, and trial (block). The first two are treated as factor variables8. Rather than using one-hot encoding or dummy variables, the age levels are left as categories and a coefficient is fit for each level. Among the benefits of this approach is the ease of interpretation and ease of working with the data programmatically. This is especially true at the subject level. If a dummy variables was used for all 45 subjects, we would have 44 different dummy variables to work with times the number of coefficients that make estimates at the subject level. The number of parameters in the model grows rapidly as the model complexity grows. Age groups and individual subjects can be indexed in the same way that number of trials is indexed. \\(S_i\\) refers to the subject in record \\(i\\), and similarly \\(G_i\\) refers to the age group of that subject. Observation 63 is for record ID av-post1-M-f-HG, so then \\(S_{63}\\) is M-f-HG and \\(G_{63}\\) is middle_age. Under the hood of R, these factor levels are represented as integers (e.g. middle age group level is stored internally as the number 2). (x &lt;- factor(c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;))) #&gt; [1] a a b c #&gt; Levels: a b c storage.mode(x) #&gt; [1] &quot;integer&quot; This data storage representation can later be exploited for the Stan model. The pre- and post-adaptation categories are treated as a binary indicator referred to as \\(trt\\) (short for treatment) since there are only two levels in the category. In this setup, a value of 1 indicates a post-adaptation block. I chose this encoding over the reverse because the pre-adaptation block is like the baseline performance, and it seemed more appropriate to interpret the post-adaptation block as turning on some effect. Using a binary indicator in a regression setting may not be the best practice as I discuss in section 3.2. In the Stan modeling language, data for a binomial model with subject and age group levels and treatment is specified as data { int N; // Number of observations int N_S; // Number of subject levels int N_G; // Number of age group levels int N_T; // Number of treatment/control groups int n[N]; // Trials per SOA int k[N]; // binomial counts vector[N] x; // SOA values int S[N]; // Subject identifier int G[N]; // Age group identifier int trt[N]; // Treatment indicator } In Stan (and unlike in R), data types must be statically declared. While sometimes a nuisance, this requirement aids in something called type inference, and also lets Stan optimize certain parts of the model. Construct Summary Statistics In order to effectively challenge the validity of the model, a set of summary statistics are constructed that help answer the questions of domain expertise consistency and model adequacy. We are studying the affects of age and temporal recalibration through the PSS and JND (see section 2.1), so it is natural to define summary statistics around these quantities to verify model consistency. Additionally the PSS and JND can be computed regardless of the model parameterization or chosen psychometric function. By the experimental setup and recording process, it is impossible that a properly conducted block would result in a JND less than 0 (i.e. the psychometric function is always non-decreasing), so that can be a lower limit for its threshold. On the other end it is unlikely that it will be beyond the limits of the SOA values, but even more concrete, it seems unlikely (though not impossible) that the just noticeable difference would be more than a second. The lower bound on the JND can be further refined if we draw information from other sources. Some studies show that we cannot perceive time differences below 30 ms, and others show that an input lag as small as 100ms can impair a person’s typing ability. Then according to these studies, a time delay of 100ms is enough to notice, and so a just noticeable difference should be much less than one second – much closer to 100ms. I’ll continue to use one second as an extreme estimate indicator, but will incorporate this knowledge when it comes to selecting priors. As for the point of subjective simultaneity, it can be either positive or negative, with the belief that larger values are more rare. Some studies suggest that for audio-visual TOJ tasks, the separation between stimuli need to be as little as 20 milliseconds for subjects to be able to determine which modality came first (Vatakis et al. 2007). Other studies suggest that our brains can detect temporal differences as small as 30 milliseconds. If these values are to be believed then we should be skeptical of PSS estimates larger than say 150 milliseconds in absolute value, just to be safe. A histogram of computed PSS and JND values will suffice for summary statistics. We can estimate the proportion of values that fall outside of our limits defined above, and use them as indications of problems with the model fitting or conceptual understanding. Post-Model, Pre-Data It is now time to define priors for the model, while still not having looked at the [distribution of] data. The priors should be motivated by domain expertise and prior knowledge, not the data. There are also many choices when it comes to selecting a psychometric (sigmoid) function. Common ones are logistic, Gaussian, and Weibull. Figure 3.1: Assortment of psychometric functions. The Weibull psychometric function is more common when it comes to 2-AFC psychometric experiments where the independent variable is a stimulus intensity (non-negative) and the goal is signal detection. The data in this paper includes both positive and negative SOA values, so the Weibull is not a natural choice. In fact, because this is essentially a model for logistic regression, my first choice is the logistic function as it is the canonical choice for Binomial data. Additionally, the data in this study are reversible. The label of a positive response can be swapped with the label of a negative response and the inferences should remain the same. Since there is no natural ordering, it makes more sense for the psychometric function to be symmetric, e.g. the logistic and Gaussian. I use symmetric loosely to mean that probability density function (PDF) is symmetric about its middle. More specifically, the distribution has zero skewness. In practice, there is little difference in inference between the logit and probit links, but computationally the logit link is more efficient. I am also more familiar with working on the log-odds scale compared to the probit scale, so I make the decision to go forward with the logistic function. In chapter 4 I will show how even with a mis-specified link function, we can still achieve accurate predictions. Develop Model Before moving on to specifying priors, I think it is appropriate to provide a little more background into generalized linear models (GLMs) and their role in working with psychometric functions. A GLM allows the linear model to be related to the outcome variable via a link function. An example of this is the logit link - the inverse of the logistic function. The logistic function, \\(F\\), takes \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and constrains the output to be in \\((0, 1)\\). \\[\\begin{equation} F(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\theta\\right)} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Since \\(F\\) is a strictly increasing and continuous function, it has an inverse, and the link for (3.2) is the log-odds or logit function. \\[\\begin{equation} F^{-1}(\\pi) = \\mathrm{logit}(\\pi) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{1 - \\pi}\\right) \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] By taking \\((F^{-1} \\circ F)(\\theta)\\) we can arrive at a relationship that is linear in \\(\\theta\\). \\[\\begin{align*} \\pi = F(\\theta) \\Longleftrightarrow F^{-1}(\\pi) &amp;= F^{-1}(F(\\theta)) \\\\ &amp; = \\ln\\left(\\frac{F(\\theta)}{1 - F(\\theta)}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\ln(F(\\theta)) - \\ln(1 - F(\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\theta)}{1 + \\exp(-\\theta)}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= - \\ln(1 + \\exp(-\\theta)) - \\ln(\\exp(-\\theta)) + \\ln(1 + \\exp(-\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= - \\ln(\\exp(-\\theta)) \\\\ &amp;= \\theta \\end{align*}\\] The purpose of all this setup is to show that a model for the psychometric function can be specified using a linear predictor, \\(\\theta\\). Given a simple slope-intercept model, one would typically write the linear predictor as \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta = \\alpha + \\beta x \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] This isn’t the only acceptable form; it could be written in the centered parameterization \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta = \\beta(x - a) \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] Both parameterizations will describe the same geometry, so why should it matter which form is chosen? Clearly the interpretation of the parameters change between the two models, but the reason becomes clear when you consider how the linear model relates back to the physical properties that the psychometric model describes. Take equation (3.4), substitute it in to (3.2), and then take the logit of both sides \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{logit}(\\pi) = \\alpha+\\beta x \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] Now recall that the PSS is defined as the SOA values such that the response probability, \\(\\pi\\), is \\(0.5\\). Substituting \\(\\pi = 0.5\\) into (3.6) and solving for \\(x\\) yields \\[ pss = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} \\] Similarly, the JND is defined as the difference between the SOA value at the 84% level and the PSS. Substituting \\(\\pi = 0.84\\) into (3.6), solving for \\(x\\), and subtracting off the pss yields \\[\\begin{equation} jnd = \\frac{\\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{\\beta} \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] From the conceptual analysis, it is easy to define priors for the PSS and JND, but then how does one set the priors for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)? Let’s say the prior for the just noticeable difference is \\(jnd \\sim \\pi_j\\). Then the prior for \\(\\beta\\) would be \\[ \\beta \\sim \\frac{\\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{\\pi_j} \\] The log-normal distribution has a nice property where its multiplicative inverse is still a log-normal distribution. We could let \\(\\pi_j = \\mathrm{Lognormal}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) and then \\(\\beta\\) would be distributed as \\[ \\beta \\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal}(-\\mu + \\ln(\\mathrm{logit}(0.84)), \\sigma^2) \\] This is acceptable, as it was determined last chapter that the slope must always be positive, and a log-normal distribution constrains the support to postive real numbers. Next suppose that the prior distribution for the PSS is \\(pss \\sim \\pi_p\\). Then the prior for \\(\\alpha\\) is \\[ \\alpha \\sim -\\pi_p \\cdot \\beta \\] If \\(\\pi_p\\) is set to a log-normal distribution as well, then \\(\\pi_p \\cdot \\beta\\) would also be log-normal, but there is still the problem of the negative sign. If \\(\\alpha\\) is always negative, then the PSS will also always be negative, which is certainly not always true. Furthermore, I don’t want to a priori put more weight on positive PSS values compared to negative ones, for which a lognormal distribution would not do. Let’s now go back and consider using equation (3.5) and repeat the above process. \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{logit}(\\pi) = \\beta(x - a) \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] The just noticeable difference is still given by (3.7) and so the same method for choosing a prior can be used, but the PSS is now given by \\[ pss = \\alpha \\] This is a fortunate consequence of using (3.5) because now the JND only depends on \\(\\beta\\) and the PSS only depends on \\(\\alpha\\), and now \\(\\alpha\\) can literally be interpreted as the PSS of the estimated psychometric function! Also thrown in is the ability to set a prior for \\(\\alpha\\) that is symmetric around \\(0\\) like a Gaussian distribution. This also brings me to point out the first benefit of using a modeling language like Stan over others. For fitting GLMs in R, there are a handful of functions that utilize MLE like stats::glm and others that use Bayesian methods like rstanarm::stan_glm and arm::bayesglm (Gabry and Goodrich 2020; Gelman and Su 2020). Each of these functions requires the linear predictor to be in the form of (3.4). The stan_glm function actually uses Stan in the backend to fit a model, but is limited to priors from the Student t family of distributions. By writing the model directly in Stan, the linear model can be parameterized in any way and with any prior distribution, and so allows for much more expressive modeling - a key aspect of this principled workflow. For the first iteration of this model, I am going to start with the simplest model that captures the structure of the data without including information about age group, treatment, or subject. Here is a simple model that draws information from the conceptual analysis. \\[\\begin{align*} k_i &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\\\ \\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &amp;= \\beta ( x_i - \\alpha ) \\end{align*}\\] Since I am using the linear model from (3.5), setting the priors for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) is relatively straightforward. The PSS can be positive or negative without any expected bias towards either, so a symmetric distribution like the Gaussian is a fine choice for \\(\\alpha\\) without having any other knowledge about the distribution of PSS values. Since I said earlier that a PSS value more than 150ms in absolute value is unlikely, I can define a Gaussian prior such that \\(P(|pss| &gt; 0.150) \\approx 0.01\\). Since the prior does not need to be exact, the following mean and variance suffice \\[ pss \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\Longleftrightarrow \\alpha \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\] For the just noticeable difference, I will continue to use the log-normal distribution because it is constrained to positive values and has the nice reciprocal property. The JND is expected to be close to 100ms and extremely unlikely to exceed 1 second. This implies a prior such that the mean is around 100ms and the bulk of the distribution is below 1 second - i.e. \\(E[X] \\approx 0.100\\) and \\(P(X &lt; 1) \\approx 0.99\\). This requires solving a system of nonlinear equations in two variables \\[ \\begin{cases} E[X] = 0.100 = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\sigma^2 / 2\\right) \\\\ P(X &lt; 1) = 0.99 = 0.5 + 0.5 \\cdot \\mathrm{erf}\\left[\\frac{\\ln (1) - \\mu}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sigma}\\right] \\end{cases} \\] This nonlinear system can be solved using Stan’s algebraic solver. functions { vector system(vector y, vector theta, real[] x_r, int[] x_i) { vector[2] z; z[1] = exp(y[1] + y[2]^2 / 2) - theta[1]; z[2] = 0.5 + 0.5 * erf(-y[1] / (sqrt(2) * y[2])) - theta[2]; return z; } } transformed data { vector[2] y_guess = [1, 1]&#39;; real x_r[0]; int x_i[0]; } transformed parameters { vector[2] theta = [0.100, 0.99]&#39;; vector[2] y; y = algebra_solver(system, y_guess, theta, x_r, x_i); } fit &lt;- sampling(prior_jnd, iter=1, warmup=0, chains=1, refresh=0, seed=31, algorithm=&quot;Fixed_param&quot;) sol &lt;- extract(fit) sol$y #&gt; #&gt; iterations [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] -7.501 3.225 The solver has determined that \\(\\mathrm{Lognormal}(-7.5, 3.2^2)\\) is the appropriate prior. However, simulating some values from this distribution produces a lot of extremely small values (\\(&lt;10^{-5}\\)) and a few extremely large values (\\(\\approx 10^2\\)). This is because the expected value of a log-normal random variable depends on both the mean and standard deviation. If the median is used in place for the mean, then a more acceptable prior may be determined. fit &lt;- sampling(prior_jnd_using_median, iter=1, warmup=0, chains=1, refresh=0, seed=31, algorithm=&quot;Fixed_param&quot;) sol &lt;- extract(fit) sol$y #&gt; #&gt; iterations [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] -2.303 0.9898 Sampling from a log-normal distribution with these parameters and plotting the histogram shows no inconsistency with the domain expertise. So now with a prior for the JND, the prior for \\(\\beta\\) can be determined. \\[ jnd \\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal}(-2.3, 0.99^2) \\Longleftrightarrow \\frac{1}{jnd} \\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal}(2.3, 0.99^2) \\] and \\[ \\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{jnd} \\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal}(2.8, 0.99^2) \\] The priors do not need to be too exact. Rounding the parameters for \\(\\beta\\), the simple model is \\[\\begin{align*} k_i &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\\\ \\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &amp;= \\beta ( x_i - \\alpha ) \\\\ \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\\\ \\beta &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal}(3, 1^2) \\end{align*}\\] and in Stan, the model code is data { int N; int n[N]; int k[N]; vector[N] x; } parameters { real alpha; real&lt;lower=0&gt; beta; } model { vector[N] p = beta * (x - alpha); alpha ~ normal(0, 0.05); beta ~ lognormal(3.0, 1.5); k ~ binomial_logit(n, p); } Notice that the model block is nearly identical to the mathematical model! Construct Summary Functions Whew! that was a lot of work to define the priors for just two parameters. Thankfully going forward not as much work will need to be done to expand the model. The next step is to construct any relevant summary functions. Since the distribution of posterior PSS and JND values are needed for the summary statistics, it will be nice to have a function that can take in the posterior samples for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) and return the PSS and JND values. I’ll define \\(Q\\) as a more general function that takes in the two parameters and a probability, \\(\\pi\\), and returns the distribution of SOA values at \\(\\pi\\). \\[\\begin{equation} Q(\\pi; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\mathrm{logit(\\pi)}}{\\beta} + \\alpha \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] The function can be defined in R as Q &lt;- function(p, a, b) qlogis(p) / b + a With \\(Q\\), the PSS and JND can be calculated as \\[\\begin{align} pss &amp;= Q(0.5) \\\\ jnd &amp;= Q(0.84) - Q(0.5) \\end{align}\\] Simulate Bayesian Ensemble During this step, I simulate the Bayesian ensemble and later feed the prior values into the summary functions in order to verify that there are no other inconsistencies with domain knowledge. Since the model is fairly simple, I will simulate directly in R. set.seed(124) n &lt;- 10000 a &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 0.06) b &lt;- rlnorm(n, 3.0, 1) dat &lt;- with(av_dat, list(N = N, x = x, n = n)) n_obs &lt;- length(dat$x) idx &lt;- sample(1:n, n_obs, replace = TRUE) probs &lt;- logistic(b[idx] * (dat$x - a[idx])) sim_k &lt;- rbinom(n_obs, dat$n, probs) Prior Checks This step pertains to ensuring that prior estimates are consistent with domain expertise. I already did that in the model construction step by sampling values for the just noticeable difference. The first prior chosen was not producing JND estimates that were consistent with domain knowledge, so I adjusted accordingly. That check would normally be done during this step, and I would have had to return to the model development step. Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of prior psychometric functions derived from the simulated ensemble. There are a few very steep and very shallow curves, but the majority fall within a range that appears likely. Figure 3.2: Prior distribution of psychometric functions using the priors for alpha and beta. Additionally most of the PSS values are within \\(\\pm 0.1\\) with room to allow for some larger values. Let’s check the prior distribution of PSS and JND values. Figure 3.3: PSS prior distribution. Figure 3.4: JND prior distribution. I am satisfied with the prior coverage of the PSS and JND values, and there are only a few samples that go beyond the extremes that were specified in the summary statistics step. Configure Algorithm There are a few parameters that can be set for Stan. On the user side, the main parameters are the number of iterations, the number of warm-up iterations, the target acceptance rate, and the number of chains to run. The NUTS algorithm samples in two phases: a warm-up phase and a sampling phase. During the warm-up phase, the sampler is automatically tuning three internal parameters that can significantly affect the sampling efficiency. By default, the Stan function will use half the number of iterations for warm-up and the other half for actual sampling. The full details of Stan’s HMC algorithm is described in the Stan reference manual. For now I am going to use the default algorithm parameters in Stan, and will tweak them later if and when issues arise. Fit Simulated Ensemble Nothing to say here. Only code. sim_dat &lt;- with(av_dat, list(N = N, x = x, n = n, k = sim_k)) m031 &lt;- sampling(m031_stan, data = sim_dat, chains = 4, cores = 4, refresh = 0) Algorithmic Calibration One benefit of using HMC over other samplers like Gibbs sampling is that HMC offers diagnostic tools for the health of chains and the ability to check for divergent transitions. Recall that the HMC and NUTS algorithm can be imagined as a physics simulation of a particle in a potential energy field, and a random momentum is imparted on the particle. The sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the system is called the Hamiltonian, and is conserved along the trajectory of the particle ((???)). The path that the particle takes is a discrete approximation to the actual path where the position of the particle is updated in small steps called leapfrog steps (see Leimkuhler and Reich (2004) for a detailed explanation of the leapfrog algorithm). A divergent transition happens when the simulated trajectory is far from the true trajectory as measured by the Hamiltonian. To check the basic diagnostics of the model, I run the following code. check_hmc_diagnostics(m031) #&gt; #&gt; Divergences: #&gt; 0 of 4000 iterations ended with a divergence. #&gt; #&gt; Tree depth: #&gt; 0 of 4000 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 10. #&gt; #&gt; Energy: #&gt; E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior. There is no undesirable behavior from this model, so next I check the summary statistics of the estimated parameters. The \\(\\hat{R}\\) statistic is a comparison of the measure of variance within chains and between chains. When chains have converged to a stationary distribution, the variance within and between chains is the same, and the ratio is one. Values of \\(\\hat{R} &gt; 1.1\\) are usually indicative of chains that have not converged to a common distribution. Lastly there is the effective sample size (\\(N_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\)) which is a loose measure for the autocorrelation within the parameter samples. As autocorrelation generally decreases as the lag increases, one can achieve a higher \\(N_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\) by running a chain with more samples and then thinning the samples, i.e. saving only every \\(n^{th}\\) sample. Table 3.2: Summary statistics of the fitted Bayesian ensemble. parameter mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha 0.0061 0.0001 0.0035 -0.0007 0.0129 3728 1.000 beta 10.7726 0.0054 0.2473 10.3054 11.2600 2073 1.001 Both the \\(\\hat{R}\\) and \\(N_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\) look fine for both \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), thought it is slightly concerning that \\(\\alpha\\) is centered relatively far from zero. This could just be due to sampling variance, so I will continue on to the next step. Inferential Calibration Post-Model, Post-Data Fit Observed Data All of the work up until now has been done without peaking at the observed data. Satisfied with the model so far, I can now go ahead and run the data through. obs_dat &lt;- with(av_dat, list(N = N, x = x, n = n, k = k)) m031 &lt;- sampling(m031_stan, data = obs_dat, chains = 4, cores = 4, refresh = 0) Diagnose Posterior Fit Here I repeat the diagnostic checks that I used after fitting the simulated Bayesian ensemble. check_hmc_diagnostics(m031) #&gt; #&gt; Divergences: #&gt; 0 of 4000 iterations ended with a divergence. #&gt; #&gt; Tree depth: #&gt; 0 of 4000 iterations saturated the maximum tree depth of 10. #&gt; #&gt; Energy: #&gt; E-BFMI indicated no pathological behavior. Table 3.3: Summary statistics of the fitted Bayesian ensemble. parameter mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha 0.0373 0.0001 0.0040 0.0293 0.0453 4035 0.9992 beta 8.4236 0.0039 0.1857 8.0771 8.7992 2311 1.0017 No indications of an ill-behaved posterior fit! Let’s also check the posterior distribution of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) against the prior density (3.5). Figure 3.5: Comparison of posterior distributions for alpha and beta to their respective prior distributions. The posterior distributions for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are well within the range determined by domain knowledge, and highly concentrated due to both the large amount of data and the fact that this is a completely pooled model - no stratification. As expected, the prior for the JND could have been tighter with more weight below half a second compared to the one second limit used, but this is not prior information, so it is not prudent to change the prior in this manner after having seen the posterior. As a rule of thumb, priors should only be updated as motivated by domain expertise and not by posterior distributions. Posterior Retrodictive Checks Finally it is time to run the posterior samples through the summary functions and then perform retrodictive checks. A retrodiction is using the posterior model to predict and compare to the observed data. This is simply done by drawing samples from the posterior and feeding in the observational data. This may be repeated to gain a retrodictive distribution. posterior_pss &lt;- Q(0.5, p031$alpha, p031$beta) posterior_jnd &lt;- Q(0.84, p031$alpha, p031$beta) - posterior_pss Figure 3.6: Posterior distribution of the PSS and JND. Neither of the posterior estimates for the PSS or JND exceed the extreme cutoffs set in the earlier steps, so I can be confident that the model is consistent with domain expertise. Let’s also take a second to appreciate how simple it is to visualize and summarize the distribution of values for these measures. Using classical techniques like MLE might require using bootstrap methods to estimate the distribution of parameter values, or one might approximate the parameter distributions using the mean and standard error of the mean to simulate new values. Since we have the entire posterior distribution we can calculate the distribution of transformed parameters by working directly with the posterior samples and be sure that the intervals are credible. Next is to actually do the posterior retrodictions. I will do this in two steps to better show how the distribution of posterior psychometric functions relates to the observed data, and then compare the observed data to the retrodictions. Figure 3.7 shows the result of the first step. Figure 3.7: Posterior distribution of psychometric functions using pooled observations. Next I sample parameter values from the posterior distribution and use them to simulate a new data set. In the next iteration I will show how I can get Stan to automatically produce retrodictions for me in the model fitting step. The results of the posterior retrodictions are shown in figure 3.8. alpha &lt;- sample(p031$alpha, n_obs, replace = TRUE) beta &lt;- sample(p031$beta, n_obs, replace = TRUE) logodds &lt;- beta * (av_dat$x - alpha) probs &lt;- logistic(logodds) sim_k &lt;- rbinom(n_obs, av_dat$n, probs) Figure 3.8: Observed data compared to the posterior retrodictions. The data is post-stratified by block for easier visualization. I want to make it clear exactly what the first iteration of this model tells us. It is the average distribution of underlying psychometric functions across all subjects and blocks. It cannot tell us what the differences are between pre- and post-adaptation blocks are, or even what the variation between subjects is. As such, it is only useful in determining if the average value for the PSS is different from 0 or if the average JND is different from some other predetermined level. This model is still useful given the right question, but this model cannot answer questions about group-level effects. Figure 3.8 shows that the model captures the broad structure of the observed data, but is perhaps a bit under-dispersed in the tail ends of the SOA values. Besides this one issue, I am satisfied with the first iteration of this model and am ready to proceed to the next iteration. 3.2 Iteration 2 (electric boogaloo) In this iteration I will be adding in the treatment and age groups into the model. There are no changes with the conceptual understanding of the experiment, and nothing to change with the observational space. As such I will be skipping the first three steps and go straight to the model development step. As I build the model, the number of changes from one iteration to the next should go to zero as the model expands to become only as complex as necessary to answer the research questions. Post-Model, Pre-Data Develop Model To start, let’s add in the treatment indicator and put off consideration of adding in the age group levels. In classical statistics, it is added as an indicator variable (zero or one) for both the slope and intercept (varying slopes, varying intercepts model). Let \\(trt\\) be \\(0\\) if it is the pre-adaptation block and \\(1\\) if the observation comes from the post-adaptation block. \\[ \\theta = \\alpha + \\alpha_{trt} \\times trt + \\beta \\times x + \\beta_{trt}\\times trt \\times x \\] Now when an observation comes from the pre-adaptation block (\\(trt=0\\)) the linear predictor is given by \\[ \\theta_{pre} = \\alpha + \\beta \\times x \\] and when an observation comes from the post-adaptation block (\\(trt=1\\)) the linear predictor is \\[ \\theta_{post} = (\\alpha + \\alpha_{trt}) + (\\beta + \\beta_{trt}) \\times x \\] This might seem like a natural way to introduce an indicator variable, but it comes with serious implications. This model implies that there is more uncertainty about the post-adaptation block compared to the baseline block, and this is not necessarily true. \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathrm{Var}(\\theta_{post}) &amp;= \\mathrm{Var}((\\alpha + \\alpha_{trt}) + (\\beta + \\beta_{trt}) \\times x) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha_{trt}) + x^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta) + x^2\\mathrm{Var}(\\beta_{trt}) \\end{align*}\\] On the other hand, the variance of \\(\\theta_{pre}\\) is \\[ \\mathrm{Var}(\\theta_{pre}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha) + x^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta) \\le \\mathrm{Var}(\\theta_{post}) \\] Furthermore, the intercept, \\(\\alpha\\), is no longer the average response probability at \\(x=0\\) for the entire data set, but is instead exclusively the average for the pre-adaptation block. This may not matter in certain analyses, but one nice property of multilevel models is the separation of population level estimates and group level estimates (fixed vs. mixed effects). So instead the treatment variable is introduced into the linear model as a factor variable. This essentially means that each level in the treatment gets its own parameter estimate, and this also makes it easier to set priors when there are many levels in a group (such as for the subject level). The linear model, using equation (3.5), with the treatment is written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta = (\\beta + \\beta_{trt[i]}) \\left[x_i - (\\alpha + \\alpha_{trt[i]})\\right] \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] As I add in more predictors and groups, equation (3.10) will start to be more difficult to read. What I can do is break up the slope and intercept parameters and write the linear model as \\[\\begin{align*} \\mu_\\alpha &amp;= \\alpha + \\alpha_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\mu_\\beta &amp;= \\beta + \\beta_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\theta &amp;= \\mu_\\beta (x - \\mu_\\alpha) \\end{align*}\\] In this way the combined parameters can be considered separately from the linear parameterization. Which leads me to consider the priors for \\(\\alpha_{trt}\\) and \\(\\beta_{trt}\\). The way that we can turn an normal model with categorical predictors into a multilevel model is by allowing the priors to borrow information from other groups. This is accomplished by putting priors on priors. It is easier to write down the model first before explaining how it works. \\[\\begin{align*} k_i &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\\\ \\mu_\\alpha &amp;= \\alpha + \\alpha_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\mu_\\beta &amp;= \\beta + \\beta_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &amp;= \\mu_\\beta (x_i - \\mu_\\alpha) \\\\ \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\\\ \\alpha_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{trt}^2) \\\\ \\sigma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\textrm{to be defined} \\end{align*}\\] In the above model, \\(\\alpha\\) gets a fixed prior (the same as in the first iteration), and \\(\\alpha_{trt}\\) gets a Gaussian prior with an adaptive variance term that is allowed to be learned from the data. This notation is compact, but \\(\\alpha_{trt}\\) is actually two parameters - one each for pre- and post-adaptation block - but they both share the same variance term \\(\\sigma_{trt}\\). This produces a regularizing effect where both treatment estimates are shrunk towards the mean, \\(\\alpha\\). I’ll discuss selecting a prior for the variance term shortly, but now I want to discuss setting the prior for the slope terms. Instead of modeling \\(\\beta\\) with a log-normal prior, I can sample from a normal distribution and take the exponential of it to produce a log-normal distribution. I.e. \\[ X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(3, 1^2) \\\\ Y = \\exp\\left\\lbrace X \\right\\rbrace \\Longleftrightarrow Y \\sim \\mathrm{Lognormal(3, 1^2)} \\] The motivation behind this transformation is that it is now easier to include new slope variables as an additive affect. If both \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\beta_{trt}\\) are specified with Gaussian priors, then the exponential of the sum will be a log-normal distribution! So now the model is \\[\\begin{align*} k_i &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\\\ \\mu_\\alpha &amp;= \\alpha + \\alpha_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\mu_\\beta &amp;= \\beta + \\beta_{trt[i]} \\\\ \\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &amp;= \\exp(\\mu_\\beta) (x_i - \\mu_\\alpha) \\\\ \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\\\ \\alpha_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{trt}^2) \\\\ \\beta &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(3, 1^2) \\\\ \\beta_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\gamma_{trt}^2) \\\\ \\sigma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\textrm{to be defined} \\\\ \\gamma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\textrm{to be defined} \\end{align*}\\] Deciding on priors for the variance term requires some careful consideration. In one sense, the variance term is the within group variance, but with non-linear models like logistic regression, the logit link can have undesirable or unpredictable floor and ceiling effects. Gelman and others (2006) recommends that for multilevel models with groups with less than say 5 levels to use a half Cauchy prior with a larger scale parameter. This weakly informative prior still has a regularizing affect and dissuades larger variance estimates. Even though the treatment group only has two levels, there is still value in specifying an adaptive prior for them, and there is also a lot of data for each treatment so partial pooling won’t make a difference anyway. \\[\\begin{align*} \\sigma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\\\ \\gamma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\end{align*}\\] Finally I can add in the age group level effects and specify the variance terms. \\[\\begin{align*} k_i &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\\\ \\mu_\\alpha &amp;= \\alpha + \\alpha_{trt[i]} + \\alpha_{G[i]} \\\\ \\mu_\\beta &amp;= \\beta + \\beta_{trt[i]} + \\beta_{G[i]} \\\\ \\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &amp;= \\exp(\\mu_\\beta) (x_i - \\mu_\\alpha) \\\\ \\alpha &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\\\ \\alpha_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{trt}^2) \\\\ \\alpha_{G} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau_{G}^2)\\\\ \\beta &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(3, 1^2) \\\\ \\beta_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\gamma_{trt}^2) \\\\ \\beta_{G} &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\nu_{G}^2) \\\\ \\sigma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\\\ \\gamma_{trt} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\\\ \\tau_{G} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\\\ \\nu_{G} &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{HalfCauchy}(0, 25) \\end{align*}\\] Here is the corresponding Stan code that also computes the posterior retrodictions and JND and PSS estimates. data { int N; int N_G; int N_T; int n[N]; int k[N]; vector[N] x; int G[N]; int trt[N]; } parameters { real a; real&lt;lower=machine_precision()&gt; sd_aG; real&lt;lower=machine_precision()&gt; sd_aT; real aG[N_G]; real aT[N_T]; real b; real&lt;lower=machine_precision()&gt; sd_bG; real&lt;lower=machine_precision()&gt; sd_bT; real bG[N_G]; real bT[N_T]; } model { vector[N] theta; a ~ normal(0, 0.06); aG ~ normal(0, sd_aG); aT ~ normal(0, sd_aT); sd_aG ~ cauchy(0, 25); sd_aT ~ cauchy(0, 25); b ~ normal(3.0, 1.0); bG ~ normal(0, sd_bG); bT ~ normal(0, sd_bT); sd_bG ~ cauchy(0, 25); sd_bT ~ cauchy(0, 25); for (i in 1:N) { real mu_a = a + aT[trt[i]] + aG[G[i]]; real mu_b = b + bT[trt[i]] + bG[G[i]]; theta[i] = exp(mu_b) * (x[i] - mu_a); } k ~ binomial_logit(n, theta); } generated quantities { matrix[N_G, N_T] pss; matrix[N_G, N_T] jnd; vector[N] k_pred; for (i in 1:N_G) { for (j in 1:N_T) { real mu_b = exp(b + bT[j] + bG[i]); real mu_a = a + aT[j] + aG[i]; pss[i, j] = mu_a; jnd[i, j] = logit(0.84) / mu_b; } } for (i in 1:N) { real mu_a = a + aT[trt[i]] + aG[G[i]]; real mu_b = b + bT[trt[i]] + bG[G[i]]; real p = inv_logit(exp(mu_b) * (x[i] - mu_a)); k_pred[i] = binomial_rng(n[i], p); } } Post-Model, Post-Data Fit Observed Data Diagnose Posterior Fit Posterior Retrodictive Checks 3.3 Iteration 3 (the one for me) Pre-Model, Pre-Data Conceptual Analysis Define Observational Space Construct Summary Statistics Post-Model, Pre-Data Develop Model Construct Summary Functions Simulate Bayesian Ensemble Prior Checks Configure Algorithm Fit Simulated Ensemble Algorithmic Calibration Inferential Calibration Post-Model, Post-Data Fit Observed Data Diagnose Posterior Fit Posterior Retrodictive Checks 3.4 Iteration 4 (what’s one more) Pre-Model, Pre-Data Conceptual Analysis Define Observational Space Construct Summary Statistics Post-Model, Pre-Data Develop Model Construct Summary Functions Simulate Bayesian Ensemble Prior Checks Configure Algorithm Fit Simulated Ensemble Algorithmic Calibration Inferential Calibration Post-Model, Post-Data Fit Observed Data Diagnose Posterior Fit Posterior Retrodictive Checks 3.5 Iteration 5 (final_final_draft_2.pdf) Pre-Model, Pre-Data Conceptual Analysis Define Observational Space Construct Summary Statistics Post-Model, Pre-Data Develop Model Construct Summary Functions Simulate Bayesian Ensemble Prior Checks Configure Algorithm Fit Simulated Ensemble Algorithmic Calibration Inferential Calibration Post-Model, Post-Data Fit Observed Data Diagnose Posterior Fit Posterior Retrodictive Checks 3.6 Celebrate celebrate References "],["model-checking.html", "4 Model Checking", " 4 Model Checking Diagnostics Simulation study (bigsimr?)

Often I found myself putting in vast amounts of unnecessary work - but necessary for me to do in order to realize that it is unnecessary - just because I hadn’t yet learned what the likely paths to take were. On a more personal level, my struggles were not ever really in developing a model or coding it up - in fact I could tinker with a program for hours, improving it in this way or that. For me, programming was a puzzle and an art, and I internalized the idea that I could figure out any numerical task given enough time and focus. To the contrary, I believed that writing was a chore, that writing this thesis would be like trying to dam up all the deltas in an attempt to keep the main river on course. I think of learning mathematics as learning a puzzle game. The first few puzzles are easy, but then get progressively harder. But even as the puzzles get harder, your intuitive understanding of the game improves, and you can throw away the obviously poor moves from consideration, and try paths that are more likely to move you in the direction of the correct solution. I started my journey towards obtaining a Master of Science in Statistics precisely because I knew that I could obtain a more intuitive understanding of the quantitative world that I live in, and pick up some new tools along the way to create and solve more impressive puzzles.

Below I describe three common frameworks that require varying levels of mathematical and programmatic competence.
