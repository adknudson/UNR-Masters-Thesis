Question One: Domain Expertise Consistency Is our model consistent with our domain expertise? Question Two: Computational Faithfulness Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors? Question Three: Inferential Adequacy Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions? Question Four: Model Adequacy Is our model rich enough to capture the relevant structure of the true data generating process? 5.1 Steps of the Workflow 5.2 Selecting Priors 5.2.1 Intercept 5.2.2 Slope 5.2.3 Lapse "]
