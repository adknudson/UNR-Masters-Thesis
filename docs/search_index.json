["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Soft intro to modern computing, analysis advance in CPU+programming leads to evolved statistical methods ML/DL, high dimensional analysis, big data, Bayesian techniques multidisciplinary techniques; numerical methods, probability theory, statistics, computer science, visualizations, etc root finding, change of variables, Gaussian quadrature, Hermite polynomials, Monte Carlo simulation, floating point arithmetic Organization and reproducibility are crucial in a data analysis setting pre-planning, modularity, workflows, versioning, virtual environments, DRY programming, code that is easy to read Clean data is important for good modeling garbage in leads to garbage out With the advances in computational power and high-level programming languages like Python, R, and Julia, statistical methods have evolved to be more flexible and expressive. Overview of classical modeling methods classical approaches to data analysis usually adhere to the flexibility-interpretability trade-off generally inflexible (parametric) to be more interpretable and computationally easier sometimes a model is too flexible (non-parametric) and loses crucial inferential power sometimes our assumptions about the data are invalid normality, independence, heteroskedacity, etc. often limited when it comes to statistical summaries and confidence intervals Solutions or alternatives when classical models fail Bayesian inference is a powerful, descriptive, and flexible modeling framework Bayes theorem is a simple model of incorporating prior information and data to produce a posterior probability or distribution \\(P(\\theta | X) \\propto P(X | \\theta) * P(\\theta)\\) or \\(posterior \\propto prior \\times likelihood\\) The prior is some distribution over the parameter space The likelihood is the probability of an outcome in the sample space given a value in the parameter space The posterior is the likelihood of values in the parameter space after observing values from the sample space Bayesian statistics, when described without math, actually feels natural to most people you hear hoof beats, you think horses, not zebras [unless you’re in Africa, but that’s prior information ;)] The catch is that the model is not complete as written above There is actually a denominator in Bayes’ Theorem \\(P(\\theta | X) = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\sum_i P(X | \\theta_i)} = \\frac{P(X | \\theta)\\cdot P(\\theta)}{\\int_\\Omega P(X | \\theta)d\\theta}\\) In general, the denominator is not known, or is not not easy (or possible) to calculate, but it always evaluates to a constant (hence the “proportional to”) The denominator acts as a scaling value that forces \\(P(\\theta|X)\\) to be a probability distribution (i.e. area under PDF is equal to 1) There are simulation-based techniques that let one approximate the posterior distribution without needing to know the analytic solution to the denominator I have organized this thesis as follows. In Chapter 2 I introduce the data set that drives the narrative and that motivates the adoption of Bayesian multilevel modeling. In Chapter 3 there is a review of classical approaches to modeling with psychometric data, and the benefits and drawbacks of such techniques. Chapter 4 introduces Bayesian modeling and programming frameworks for Bayesian inference. In Chapters 5 and 6 I describe and work through a principled Bayesian workflow for multilevel modeling. Chapters 7 and 8 go into more depth on checking the model goodness of fit and model diagnostics in a Bayesian setting. Finally in Chapter 9 I demonstrate how to use the Bayesian model from the principled workflow for predictive inference, and generate multivariate synthetic data via Gaussian copulas. "],

For example, if \\(j[35]=3\\), then the \\(35^{th}\\) unit in the data belongs to the third age group. Coefficients are written with \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and sometimes \\(\\gamma\\) We make our code more readable by typing \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) as a, b, g Standard deviation is \\(\\sigma_y\\) for data-level errors and \\(\\sigma_\\alpha\\), \\(\\sigma_\\beta\\), and so forth, for group-level errors References "],
