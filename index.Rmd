# Preface {-}

In this collection, I will be building a narrative around general linear models as I take an experiment in psychometrics and perform a complete analysis from the ground up.

## Thesis Related Stuff

```{theorem, label="thm-label", name="Name of the Theorem"}
If a model is hierarchical, then it is multilevel.
```

```{remark}
This is really more of a tautology then a theorem.
```

```{corollary}
If a model is multilevel, then it is hierarchical.
```
