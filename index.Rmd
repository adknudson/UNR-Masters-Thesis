# Abstract {-}

**Big Idea:** _making contributions to & gaining mastery of state of the art statistical computing tools and Bayesian modeling/probabilistic programming._

# Preface {-}

In this collection, I will be building a narrative around general linear models as I take an experiment in psychometrics and perform a complete analysis from the ground up.
