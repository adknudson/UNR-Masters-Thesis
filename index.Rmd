# Abstract {-}

**Big Idea:** _making contributions to & gaining mastery of state of the art statistical computing tools and Bayesian modeling/probabilistic programming._

# Acknowledgments {-}

I would like to first and foremost thank my sister Heather for always being a constant source of sarcasm and teasing. Without her skepticism I would not have had enough motivation to finish this degree out of spite, and instead would have had to rely on self-discipline and encouragement from my peers and mentors.
