# Preface {-}

In this collection, I will be building a narrative around general linear models as I take an experiment in psychometrics and perform a complete analysis from the ground up. 

## Ideas {-}

- Introduce the data
- classical regression
- Bayesian regression
- Choice of priors
- Standardization
- Multilevel modeling
  - Robustness
  - Flexibility
  - Performance
- Pooling
  - no pooling
  - partial pooling
  - complete pooling
- Adaptive regularization
- Residual analysis
- Predictive inference
- Using bigsimr to simulate data sets
